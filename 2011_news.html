      			<p>What a great weekend for the Colts family!

	</div>
      <img src="img/news/2011_show.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
      <p><i>May 11, 2011</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts are proud to present their 2011 program... <b>DECEPTION: The Jagged Edge</b></p>
                <p>Inspired by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's epic ballet <i>Swan Lake</i>, and Darren Aronofsky's mesmerizing Academy Award nominated film, <i>Black Swan</i>, the Colts present our own tale of deception about the jagged edge between innocence and the dark side within.</p>
<p><i>"Art is the most beautiful deception of all."</i> - Claude Debussy</p>
<p>The jagged edge is <i>"a feeling all performers are familiar with, the spooky sense, when you're in full flight, that you've crossed over into the dark territory of dream, or fairy tale, somewhere you haven't seen before. It's the exhilaration of losing yourself, and the fear of being lost to yourself forever."</i> - Terrence Rafferty, <i>New York Times</i> (October 30, 2010).</p>
<p>Musical selections include:<br>
<i>Swan Lake</i> -  Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky<br>
<i>Danza de los Duendes</i> - Nancy Galbraith<br>
<i>The Swan</i> from Carnival of the Animals - Camille Saint-Saens<br>
<i>Mind Heist</i> - Zack Hemsey<br></p>

<p>Our program also features original music and arrangements by Chris Tomsa, Jerry Carpenter and Rich Viano. Program coordination is by Chris Tomsa and visual coordination by Stephanie Furniss. Drill design is by Andrew Ebert and color guard designs are by Charles Williams, Christopher Dulin, Ashley Studer, Brandon Smith, Amy Braun, Erin Culver, and Carla Burgess-Tomsa.</p>

      <p><i>May 3, 2011</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts are not in this contest since we were one of the top 100 charities last year, where we won $25,000. A number of organizations, including several corps and Drum Corps International, are in the contest this time around. The rules and format have changed this year, so this voting session is for organizations with an operating budget of between $1 million and $10 million. The winning organization receives a contribution from Chase in the amount of - ready..... ? $25,000 now and the possibility of another $500,000!</p>
                <p>YEA (The Cadets) and Drum Corps International are currently both near the top of the rankings recently and other corps are doing well, too. Please do your part to support all the drum corps and our other friends when you use your 10 votes today! VOTE TODAY! Here is a link to our "favorite organizations" that we hope you will consider supporting - please use all 10 of your votes! <a href="http://www.dci.org/_now/20110502_now_chase.htm">CLICK HERE</a> Please forward this link to as many of your friends as you can, and encourage them to vote today too!</p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>February 17, 2011</i></p>
      			<p>The first rehearsal of the Colt Cadets 2011 season will be held at Jefferson Middle School on Sunday, February 20, from 1:00-5:00 pm. Find directions to Jefferson <a href="http://colts.org/directions.asp#jeff">HERE</a>. No RSVP is necessary for this rehearsal. All equipment will be provided. A parent meeting will be held at the beginning of all rehearsals to answer questions and provide further information.</p>
                <p>Membership is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no audition to be a member, but students are expected to be good team players with a desire to be great!</p>
                <p>The first few rehearsals are approached as clinics, so that any young person can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to explore a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best.</p>
                <p>The Colt Cadets rehearse three Sundays per month during the school year, and Tues/Wed/Thurs/Sat during the summer.  The group will travel about 23 days during the summer months. In 2011, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Last season marked the first time Cadets were Open Class Finalists. The corps will perform for over 75,000 people in 7 states!</p>
                <p>Most members participate in other summer activities while performing with the Colt Cadets. It is possible to make a variety of summer schedules work! If you have questions about your specific summer plans, do not hesitate to call or email, and feel free to bring your summer schedule to an open rehearsal, and staff will provide more insight on how to balance summer plans.</p>
                <p>All instruments, uniforms, and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of the membership fees.</p>
                <p>Please call 563-582-4872 or e-mail <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">Vicki Schaffer</a>, Colt Cadets Director, with any questions! We will help in any way we can!</p>
                <p>A second open rehearsal will be held on Sunday, February 27, from 1:00-5:00 pm, at Jefferson Middle School for anyone unable to attend the opening event. Although all students are encouraged to attend the first rehearsal, students living 4 hours or more from Dubuque may find the February 27 rehearsal more valuable.</p>
