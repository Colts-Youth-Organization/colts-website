We will provide all instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group. Please wear the audition t-shirt for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br> 		We provide ground transportation anytime to and from the Dubuque Regional Airport (DBQ) for Dubuque camps. We can also accommodate flights into surrounding airports (Quad Cities, Madison, Rockford, or Cedar Rapids). <b>You MUST notify the office prior to booking a flight into anywhere other than Dubuque.</b> MLI (Moline) and CID (Cedar Rapids) are very close to Dubuque and reasonable in fare. ORD (O'Hare) travel MUST land prior to 3:30 pm on Friday and depart no earlier than 7:30 pm on Sunday. MDW (Midway) travel MUST land prior to 2:30 pm on Friday and depart no earlier than 8:30 pm on Sunday. If you plan on using either of these airports, please let <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> know prior to booking flights.<br> 		<br> 		If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call <a href="tel:5635824872">563.582.4872</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="/rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. All flight details should also be listed on your RSVP.</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br> 		There are positions available in the brass line and color guard. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year.<br> 		<br> 		If this is your second or third rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.<br> 		<br> 		Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br> 		Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="/rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br> 		<br> 		If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>PARENTS</b><br> 		An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a location to be announced. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend.<br> 		<br> 		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br> 		<br> 		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.<br> 		<br> 		Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href="https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="blank" >Hampton Inn</a> here in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a> and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.<br> 		<br> 		Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="/signupform" target="blank">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.<br> 		<br> 		All parents and volunteers are Colts Boosters! Plan on joining us Saturday morning, before or after breakfast (approximately 8:30 am), to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places to start with questions about where you can help.</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>SOUVENIR SALES</b><br> 		Throughout the weekend, all items in the <a href="https://store.colts.org" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a> will be available for sale! Summer is coming up soon, and the weekend will be a great time to purchase a present for your special someone! Anyone is able to purchase souvenirs - students, parents, friends, family, etc. The souvenir racks will be set up by the check in table, and you can purchase your items there.</p> 		<br> 		 	<p><b>EARLY MOVE-IN FOR GUARD AND PERCUSSION</b><br> 		We will be staying at the Dubuque Armory again this season, and bussing to fields. Please plan on arriving at 6:00 pm on Sunday evening May 21, so we may begin rehearsal bright and early Monday morning, May 22.</p> 	<p>If your parents are able to volunteer for a day or two during this time, we would be VERY EXCITED to have them with us! Please have them contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">Vicki</a> to help during this time.</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>MAY \ SPRING TRAINING \ AUGUST AIRLINE PLANS</b><br> 		We can pick you up at the airport or bus station in Dubuque. If you need assistance getting here from another airport, please call us before booking flights. Rides from other local airports such as Moline (MLI) or Cedar Rapids (CID) can generally be accommodated.</p> 	<p>To arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call <a href="tel:5635824872">563.582.4872</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="/rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a>.</p> 	<p>For those who will be flying home after finals, please note: You should purchase a plane ticket home no earlier than 6:00 am on Sunday, August 13, from the Indianapolis Airport (IND). We will run a bus from the stadium to the Indianapolis Airport after finals early Sunday morning. A fun-filled overnight at the airport awaits you with about 2,000 other corps members!</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br> 		These parts have been added to your bill and will be emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out at the Memorial Day camp. Each brass and battery member receive a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals/DM also purchase gloves). Prices for Brass/Cymbals/DM will be $100; Battery $80 (no gloves); Front Ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $150 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag and other necessary personal items.</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 10, 2017</b><br> 		This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p> 	<p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 10.</p> 	<p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $45,000 in our one-day event!</p> 	<p>Please plan, so that you can do your share. It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones.</p> 	<p>The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel. It's extra important that we do well this year with what is happening in the world and with beef prices going crazy.</p> 	<p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge of a penny per car total will end up being around $8. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received for you. We then collect these payments through the office by mail. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>REMAINING REHEARSALS</b><br> 		May 21, 2017: Pre-season Move In for Guard and Percussion, Dubuque Armory<br> 		May 26, 2017: Move In For Summer, Roosevelt Middle School, Dubuque<br> 		May 29, 2017: Parade and Summer debut concert in Dubuque, Iowa</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>EMAIL AND WEBSITE</b><br> 		Please make sure you have received audition information in your area of interest!
