								<img src="img/staff/jschubert.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
								<p class="no-margin-top">Jason grew up in the Chicago suburb of Wheaton and comes to the Colts via Lexington, Kentucky. He is a 2016 graduate of the University of Kentucky with a Bachelor's degree in community and leadership development and minors in Spanish and music.</p>
                                <p>Jason began his drum corps career in 2011 as a tuba player with the Colts, and went on to march a total of four years with the organization. In 2012 and 2013, he was tuba section leader, and aged out in 2014 as drum major. After aging out, Jason joined the admin staff, spending the 2015 summer as assistant tour director and social media manager. For the 2016 season, Jason took on the role of tour director, which following the season, transitioned into a full time position with the Colts. His current roles are director of operations and media and tour director for the Colts. Throughout the offseason, Jason handles all social media for the organization, the website, donor and alumni database management, souvenirs, and camp logistics. Over the summer, Jason works closely with Vicki MacFarlane and Mike Lang to oversee all travel and housing logistics for the corps, as well as managing the props. Of course, all encompassing in his various jobs is the ubiquitous non-profit job description “other duties as assigned.”</p>
                                <p>While at the University of Kentucky, Jason was an active member of the Wildcat Marching Band for three years, playing at all home football games, and many of the men’s and women’s home basketball games. He also spent four years with the university’s volunteer office, the Center for Community Outreach. For two years, he was director of the office’s alternative breaks program, planning 15 service trips each year for students and staff, and overseeing, instructing, and participating in the program’s intensive leadership training course. In his final year at Kentucky, Jason was director of the office, overseeing 11 different volunteer-based student-led programs and over 200 student leaders on various levels of involvement. Jason was also an active member of the Alpha Gamma chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, spending one year as fraternity education officer and two years as president. For three of his years in Lexington, Jason was a marching technician with the Lafayette High School marching band.</p>
                                <p>Jason is an avid lover of all things Kentucky, frequently wearing apparel from the university or the state, and always making sure to use “y’all” instead of “you guys.” He is a huge fan of Kentucky basketball, as well as the Chicago Cubs and Bears. During his down time, Jason enjoys hiking, camping, working out at the local Crossfit gym, and dreaming about owning a dog. Or two dogs. </p>
