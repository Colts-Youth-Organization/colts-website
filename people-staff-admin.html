								<img src="img/staff/jmacfarlane.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">

								<p class="no-margin-top">Jeff is a long-time drum corps junkie having grown up as the youngest of five marching siblings of the Colts. He started as a snare drummer with the Colt Cadets in 1973-74, graduated to the 'A' Corps on bass with the Colt .45 in 1975, and marched his last two years as a tenor (CQB!) in the Colts in 1976-77. He regrets that he left a few good years on the shelf having not marched until aging out. In 2009, Jeff returned to the drumline as the oldest marching member of the Colts Presidential Inaugural Parade Corps.</p>
								<p>Jeff currently serves as executive director for the Colts Youth Organization where he oversees the business operations for the nonprofit corporation. He was previously the group's controller (2005-12), and program coordinator for the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps (2008-12). He first became a member of the Colts Cadets design team in 2006 where he brought his 20+ years of graphic design experience to the football field in several visual capacities. He also works on graphic design and marketing projects for the organization.</p>
								<p>Jeff received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Communication from Northern Illinois University in 1984. In 1994, he started his own business - Get Smart Design Company - doing logos, brochures, advertising and websites for businesses throughout the Midwest, as well as an occassional pro bono project for the Colts.</p>
								<p>In 1998, Get Smart Design was one of ten small businesses in Iowa to receive the Benchmark Award from the Iowa Secretary of State for entreprenurial spirit and community good deeds. Jeff received the Silver Medal from the <a href="http://www.aafdubuque.com/">Advertising Club of Dubuque</a> in 1998 -- a lifetime achievement award, of sorts. In 2000, he was named the American Advertising Federation's 9th District President of the Year.</p>
								<p>Having sold the business (then known as Mission Creative) in 2003, he was between jobs in 2005 when an "opportunity" to help in the Colts office selling Music On The March tickets eventually led to his current position.</p>
								<p>Jeff is so proud of his two kids, Max (a former Colt Cadet and resident of Fort Collins, Colorado) and Maddie (an avid hockey fan and published photographer with a master's degree in sports management). He is also quite proud to work side-by-side with his wife, Vicki, trying to make the Colts organization the best it can be.</p>

								<p class="no-margin-top">As director of youth programs, Vicki is responsible for the operations of the Colts Youth Organization, which includes the World Class Colts Drum & Bugle Corps, the Open Class Colt Cadets, and the Colts Summer Band. At the 2018 Drum Corps International World Championships, Vicki was awarded the George Bonfiglio Chairperson's Award. She was also honored with a Women of Achievement Award for service and support of nonprofit work in May 2018.</p>
								<p>Vicki began working for the Colts in May 2001, and was director of the Colt Cadets from 2002-2012. Besides making sure everyone was in the right place at the right time, she spent valuable time working with the Cadets instructional team and strengthening the visual program. In her time as director, she saw the membership grow from a perfectly-proportioned ensemble of 18 (six each of brass, percussion and color guard) to become a DCI Open Class Finalist for the first time in 2010, and repeating that distinction again in 2011 and 2012. The Colt Cadets were named Most Improved Corps in DCI's Division II in 2006.</p>
								<p>Vicki served six terms as chair of Drum Corps International's Open Class Advisory Committee where she acted as liaison between the Open Class directors and DCI's Board of Directors. She resigned that position in January 2013, when she became director of the Colts.</p>
								<p>Vicki played baritone for the Colts in 1994 and 1995. She also marched baritone in the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Parade in Washington, D.C. Her favorite bit of musicianship was on the clarinet as a member of the Wartburg College Concert Band on their 40-day tour of Europe where she soloed during Rhapsody In Blue</p>
								<p>She moved to Dubuque in May 2001 from the English Valleys Community School District, where she served as the 5th-12th grade instrumental music director (as well as "coach" for a variety of sports) from 1998-2001. She earned her degree in music education from Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa. Vicki serves as an active educator, clinician, and adjudicator in Iowa and the Midwest. She has taught clarinet privately, and has performed with the Waterloo/Cedar Falls and Cedar Rapids Symphony Orchestras.</p>
								<p>Vicki lives with her husband, Jeff, in their ofttimes-staff-filled home in the Cedar Lake subdivision.</p>

With the growth of the program, he transitioned to teaching 7th grade through 12th grade until his departure in 2011. In the fall of 2011, Rich accepted the position of director of bands at Oskaloosa High School in southeast Iowa. The program enjoyed many years of success in its rich history in all areas, including marching band, concert band, and jazz band.</p>
                                <p>Rich and his wife, Angie, have two children, Carter and Morgan -- both Colt Cadets. Following the 2019 season, they moved to Dubuque when Rich accepted a full-time position with the Colts Youth Organization. He enjoys spending time at home with his family, cooking, doing projects around the house, and working on his model trains. The whole family was involved with Colt Cadets in 2018-19, and they look forward to many more seasons of fun with the Colts organization!</p>

								<p class="no-margin-top">Jason grew up in the Chicago suburb of Wheaton and comes to the Colts via Lexington, Kentucky. He is a 2016 graduate of the University of Kentucky with a Bachelor's degree in community and leadership development and minors in Spanish and music.</p>
                                <p>Jason began his drum corps career in 2011 as a tuba player with the Colts, and went on to march a total of four years with the organization. In 2012 and 2013, he was tuba section leader, and aged out in 2014 as drum major. After aging out, Jason joined the admin staff, spending the 2015 summer as assistant tour director and social media manager. For the 2016 season, Jason took on the role of tour director, which following the season, transitioned into a full time position with the Colts. His current roles are director of operations and media and tour director for the Colts. Throughout the offseason, Jason handles all social media for the organization, the website, donor and alumni database management, souvenirs, and camp logistics. Over the summer, Jason works closely with Vicki MacFarlane and Mike Lang to oversee all travel and housing logistics for the corps, as well as managing the props. Of course, all encompassing in his various jobs is the ubiquitous non-profit job description “other duties as assigned.”</p>
                                <p>While at the University of Kentucky, Jason was an active member of the Wildcat Marching Band for three years, playing at all home football games, and many of the men’s and women’s home basketball games. He also spent four years with the university’s volunteer office, the Center for Community Outreach. For two years, he was director of the office’s alternative breaks program, planning 15 service trips each year for students and staff, and overseeing, instructing, and participating in the program’s intensive leadership training course. In his final year at Kentucky, Jason was director of the office, overseeing 11 different volunteer-based student-led programs and over 200 student leaders on various levels of involvement. Jason was also an active member of the Alpha Gamma chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, spending one year as fraternity education officer and two years as president. For three of his years in Lexington, Jason was a marching technician with the Lafayette High School marching band.</p>
                                <p>Jason is an avid lover of all things Kentucky, frequently wearing apparel from the university or the state, and always making sure to use “y’all” instead of “you guys.” He is a huge fan of Kentucky basketball, as well as the Chicago Cubs and Bears. During his down time, Jason enjoys hiking, camping, working out, and dreaming about owning a dog. Or two dogs. </p>

								<p class="no-margin-top">After watching the Colts rehearse each summer in his hometown of DeWitt, Iowa, Aidan first joined the Colts in 2015 as a baritone player. His next two summers were filled with summer classes, traveling and an internship, but he came back to age out with the corps in 2018.</p>
								<p>In 2019, Aidan returned as a volunteer, completing various tasks during the offseason and serving as a driver for three weeks in the summer. Now, he’s filling the role of Director of Media and Events. Aidan creates and organizes content for the corps’ website, newsletters and social media pages, and he also works to schedule and facilitate recruiting, audition and competitive events for the organization.</p>
								<p>Prior to working for the Colts full-time, Aidan worked as an analytics consultant for Digital IQ. He also served as a drumline instructor for the Central DeWitt High School marching band.</p>
								<p>Aidan is an alumnus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he earned his Bachelor of Journalism degree with minors in informatics, mathematics, music and music technology. As a student, Aidan played baritone in the Cornhusker Marching Band and participated in various choral ensembles.</p>
                                <p>Outside of work, Aidan spends his time cooking, riding his bike, cheering on the Cornhuskers and traveling to stay in touch with friends. He’s still an active piano and organ player, and he’ll attend pretty much any concert. Especially if it’s free.</p>

								<p class="no-margin-top">Megan has been involved in the marching arts since 2008, when she started her marching career with the Kenosha Beats, an independent percussion ensemble out of her hometown of Kenosha, Wisconsin. Her introduction to drum corps was with the Kilties Drum & Bugle Corps, based out of Racine, Wisconsin, in 2010.

She has also enjoyed being a part of recreational ensembles, playing bass drum with the Milwaukee Bucks drumline, as well as the Tundraline, the offical drumline of the Green Bay Packers.</p>
								<p>Her past teaching career includes experience as a technician, coordinator, arranger, and consultant, spanning front ensemble work with the Kilties Drum & Bugle Corps, various Wisconsin schools, including Sauk Prairie High School, various indoor drum lines in Wisconsin, and Thomas Worthington High School, Westerville North High School, Westerville South High School, Springboro High School, and Kettering Fairmont High School out of Ohio. Megan was also the front ensemble coordinator for ConneXus, a WGI Independent Open Class finalist.</p>
                                <p>Megan spent the 2017 drum corps season as an assistant tour director with the Colts, and in 2018-19 spent the summers teaching the front ensemble with Colt Cadets. Megan is excited to live in Dubuque and take on a larger role within the Colts!</p>
