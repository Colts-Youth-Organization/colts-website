		</div>
	</div>
                <p><i>December 22, 2016</i></p>
                <p>When the Dubuque Racing Association announced their grant awards to local nonprofit organizations this year, the Colts Youth Organization was pleased to learn it received $10,000 for the purchase of a kitchen trailer for the Colt Cadets. This was the 20th consecutive year that the Colts received a grant of $5,000 or more from the DRA.</p>
                <p>This trailer, now affectionately known as the "Chuck Wagon," transformed the way the Colt Cadets parents and volunteers were able to prepare, cook and serve the drum corps throughout the summer. In total, the Colt Cadets prepare an average of 400 meals per day during their 45-day tour. The new trailer is outfitted with one fridge and two freezers and has space to store dry goods, a rolling can rack, and a rolling convection oven set-up. The entire trailer can be powered through an extension cord.</p>
                <p>The Chuck Wagon was used throughout the summer by the Colt Cadets and in the winter is being used by the Colts to transport food and cooking supplies to winter audition camps.</p>
                <p>The Dubuque Racing Association (DRA) is the nonprofit license holder for the Mystique and Diamond Jo casinos. Grants have been offered to area nonprofit organizations through a competitive submission process since 1985.</p>
                <p>Last year, the Colts received a $10,000 grant from the DRA for the purchase a new pop-up souvenir selling tent, The Red Zone.</p>
                <p>Two years prior, the Colts received a $12,500 grant from the DRA for the purchase of percussion equipment for the Colts Cadets.</p>
                <p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $360,000 for new instruments, uniforms, vehicles and trailers, computers and other equipment, and building improvements.</p>
                <p>Thank you to the DRA for continuing to support the vision of the Colts Youth Organization and our mission to "use music & excellence to teach other about success in life."</p>

		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>December 19, 2016</i></p>
                <p>The Colt Cadets will kick off the 2017 season with the first open rehearsal on February 12 from 1:00 to 5:00 pm at Table Mound Elementary in Dubuque. This preseason event is <b>FREE</b> to attend! Students are encouraged to arrive at 12:30 pm to sign in, meet new faces and help set up equipment. Come experience drum corps, bring a friend and see if the Colt Cadets is the place for <i>you!</i></p>
               <p>Colt Cadets winter rehearsals will continue February 26 and March 5 at Table Mound Elementary. This school is new for the Colt Cadets, but will be a great facility for the corps to use! An added benefit is the close proximity of the school to our new offices and warehouse building - just up the street! A full list of preseason rehearsals and the 2017 membership brochure will be released soon. You can view the 2017 Colt Cadets summer schedule <a href="/schedule-cadets" target="blank">HERE</a>. 
               <p>Help save time at check in! Fill out an <a href="/memberapp" target="blank">ONLINE APPLICATION</a> and print your <a href="/documents/cadets_permission.pdf" target="blank">PARENT CONSENT FORM</a> ahead of time. All students under the age of 18 must turn in a signed parent consent form to participate.</p>
               <p>All 2017 preseason rehearsals will take place at a school in the Dubuque area. Most Colt Cadets rehearsals are on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of two overnight camps for the full corps and one additional overnight camp for the battery. Those who might need transportation for rehearsals should contact David Alford, Colt Cadets Director, at <a href="mailto:david@colts.org">david@colts.org</a> to set up travel arrangements.</p>
               <p>Membership in the Colt Cadets is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no formal audition to be a member, but students are expected to be strong team players with a desire to be great!</p>
               <p>These rehearsals are approached as clinics, so any young person can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to experience a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best.</p>
               <p>During the summer, the Colt Cadets will travel about 45 days between mid-June and mid-August, and will perform for more than 75,000 people across the Midwest. In 2017, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships. The Colt Cadets have also made consistent appearances in Open Class finals in Michigan City, Indiana throughout the past decade.</p>
               <p>All instruments, uniforms and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of their summer membership fees.</p>
               <p>To learn more about the Colt Cadets, you can click <a href="/program-cadets" target="blank">HERE</a>.</p>
               <p>Students who live exceptionally far away from Dubuque should contact either <a href="mailto:david@colts.org">David</a> or the Colts office at (563-582-4872) to discuss how they can participate.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colt Cadets Announce 2017 Brass Team</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>December 14, 2016</i></p>
                <p>The Colt Cadets are proud to announce their brass team for the 2017 season. A combination of new and old faces, many of whom are alumni of the organization, will create a strong and dynamic team. The team will work closely with and be supported by Colt Cadets Director David Alford and the entire Colt Cadets design team.</p>
                <p>Leading the brass team will be Caption Head <b>Kara Metzger</b>. Kara is a Colts alumna, having aged out as drum major in the 2015 season. She spent the 2016 season on brass staff with Colt Cadets and is currently the director of bands at Whitman Middle School and associate director of bands at West High School in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. This will be Kara's first season as caption head.</p>
                <p>"I am extremely excited to continue my journey with the Colts organization and help the Colt Cadet brass program to grow," said Caption Head Kara Metzger. "The combination new and old of staff members creates a team with good chemistry. Each person on this team is a great educator and highly qualified. I am proud to be part of a great team and cannot wait to begin working with the Colt Cadet brass line."</p>
                <p>Joining the Colt Cadets brass team will also be Colts alumni <b>Carl Mathwig</b> and <b>Shawn Coleman</b>. Along with teaching brass, Carl will be working on developing and refining the Colt Cadets marching style and providing guidance on the visual components of the show. Returning to the brass team from the 2016 season will be <b>Eric Angeroth Franks</b>. <b>Andrew Eaton</b> will also be an integral part of the brass team for the 2017 season, in addition to his roles as assistant corps director.</p>
                <p>"Having Kara return to Colt Cadets in her new role as brass caption head is an incredible opportunity for us," said Colt Cadets Director David Alford. "Additionally, having both Eric and Andrew return to the field as instructors will allow us to provide consistency for the brass members while building and growing the program to the next level. It's an added benefit to have Kara from the same educational background as our program coordinator, Phil Snyder. I'm also very excited for Carl Mathwig to be joining us, especially after he has worked extensively with Phil at his high school program. While we will continue to add instructors to the brass caption, I feel confident with the level of talent and leadership already committed to our program that will ensure 2017 to be an historic year for our corps."</p>

		</div>
	</div>
				<img src="/img/news/warehouse.jpg" height="125" width="175" alt="Warehouse Picture" class="alignleft imageborder">
                <p><i>December 7, 2016</i></p>
                <p>Since early October, the Colts have been fully operational out of their new building at 2300 Twin Valley Drive. Because the offices are not finished, all work is being done from inside the warehouse in a very modern, open floor plan design (pictured at left). This current set up is just temporary, and the projected timeline to finish all construction is May 1. But, like any good project, it will never fully be done and there will always be things to improve upon. Various stages are already being planned for the building in the future, including leveling the cement pads in the parking lot, a grant for solar panels, a movie screen, and more. Thank you to every parent, member, alum, and volunteer who has helped in the moving and construction so far! The Colts are truly thankful to have such a wonderful support system. This project wouldn't be possible without you!</p>
                <p>Construction is still underway, but is going smoothly. Earlier this week, the framing around the boardroom was finished and new cement was poured in the basement to finish the plumbing project for the second bathroom. Other exciting things off the to-do list have been moving the entryway stairs, drywalling of the upstairs bathroom, framing of the upstairs offices, and assembling of the final shelving units. The next projects to finish will be the loft office and atrium area outside the boardroom. To view updated pictures from the construction, you can <a href="/movingpictures" target="blank">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>
                <p>This fall has been an exciting time for the organization and has shifted how the Colts operate in many ways. By having all vehicles on one site, loading and unloading for camps has gone far smoother. Cleaning vehicles and organizing all the miscellaneous parts for vehicles has also become a much simpler job. The move has also allowed the Colts to take a close look at all processes related to the organization. One process that is undergoing change is printing, with steps being taken to reduce the amount of paper used by the organization. Additionally, having a 9,000 square feet warehouse has allowed both staff and volunteers to take a full look at everything the Colts owns and gain a far better understanding of new items to purchase and what items there are more than enough of. For example, so far 27 hammers have been found in the process of moving and organizing the tool shelves.</p>
                <p>The sale of the Colts Center, located at 1101 Central Avenue, to the City of Dubuque will be complete very soon. The agreement to purchase the Colts Center was the first step in a multi-million dollar expansion and remodeling of the <a href="https://www.mfcdbq.org" target="blank">Multicultural Family Center</a>. The expansion will include additional meeting space, presentation areas and office suites, and will allow the center to meet the needs of the city as Dubuque continues to grow.</p>
                <p>To celebrate the move and showcase all the new and exciting features of the warehouse, a new campaign titled #WarehouseWednesday is starting on Colts social media. Be sure to follow along on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dcicolts/" target="blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dcicolts" target="blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dcicolts/" target="blank">Instagram</a>. New updates will be posted every Wednesday! </p>

                <br>
                <p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
We provide ground transportation anytime to and from the Dubuque Regional Airport (DBQ) for Dubuque camps. We can also accommodate flights into surrounding airports (Quad Cities MLI, Madison, Rockford, or Cedar Rapids CID) but you must notify us prior to booking. MLI (Moline) and CID (Cedar Rapids) are very close to Dubuque and reasonable in fare. ORD (O'Hare) and MDW (Midway) travel MUST land prior to 3:30 p.m. on Friday and depart no earlier than 7:30 p.m. on Sunday. If you plan on using either of these airports, please let <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> know prior to booking flights.
				<br><br>
                If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call 563-582-4872. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a>. All flight details should also be listed on your RSVP.</p>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
There are positions available in every section of the corps. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.
				<br><br>
                If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.
                <br><br>
                Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
				If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a classroom at the middle school. Bring all of your questions!  A similar meeting will also take place at the January rehearsal weekend if you are unable to attend this month.

                <p><i>November 29, 2016</i></p>
                <p>The Colts are pleased to welcome Gordon Henderson as the brass arranger for the 2017 season. Gordon will be joining the design team, led by Program Coordinator Howard Weinstein, and working closely with Battery Arranger Ben Pyles and Front Ensemble Arranger David Nelson. Gordon is currently the director of bands and Department of Music vice chair at University of California, Los Angeles. He is also the director of the Bruin Marching Band and the Varsity Band.</p>
                <p>"I am incredibly excited to be stepping back into the drum corps activity with the Colts," said Gordon. "Howard has already built a solid foundation for the program and I cannot wait to begin working with the rest of the design team. I also am looking forward to working with the skilled and dedicated educators on staff this season to create an impactful and unique experience for the members."</p>
                <p>Since 1990, Gordon has served as the arranger for the Tenrikyo Aimachi Marching Band in Nagoya, Japan. In 2016, Aimachi won the WGI Winds International World Division, become the first group from outside of the U.S. to win any division at WGI Finals. Gordon has also worked with several drum corps throughout his career, including Santa Clara Vanguard Drum & Bugle Corps, The Cavaliers Drum & Bugle Corps, The Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps, and the Troopers Drum & Bugle Corps.</p>
                <p>"Gordon Henderson is a legacy in the drum corps activity, and I could not be more thrilled to have his talents among the Colts design team," said Program Coordinator Howard Weinstein. "Gordon is the perfect addition to not only our design team, but also our brass program. We are in great hands."</p>
                <p>"Gordon's experience and success at the highest levels of the marching arts will be tremendous for our program and our members," said Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane. "We have great respect for Gordon's work, especially his influence in the international music community. I am very excited to have Howard and Gordon working together this season and to see Gordon's music come to life."</p>

                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Students stay overnight in the gym on the floor, as you will all summer. Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans please), and tennis shoes (no high tops, please). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Please bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the weekend. To speed up the check in process, it is recommended that you email a picture of yourself (think headshot or selfie) to <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last) and which audition camp you will be attending in the email. This picture is printed on your audition form so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. There will also be a camera at check in if you are unable to submit a picture ahead of time.<br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Please bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you do not have access to an instrument and will need one provided, please contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest: Trumpet, Mellophone, Baritone/Euphonium, or Tuba. You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude or excerpt you feel comfortable with. For the Sunday afternoon performance, please wear the audition t-shirt and jeans.<br>
                <br>
                Color Guard: Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), black pants or shorts and a black shirt for Sunday's performance, your own rifle and/or sabre (if you can), and knee pads (if you like).

                <br>

Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest: Battery, Cymbals, or Front Ensemble.

				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 9:00 p.m. at the high school. Bring all your questions! We know you have plenty of them. A similar meeting will also take place at the December and January rehearsal weekends if you are unable to attend this month.<br>
Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out all about our program, meet the other parents and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and occasionally assist with some repair work or construction projects. We can always find something to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.<br>
 Parents are welcome to stay overnight in designated rooms at the high school with sleeping bags/air mattresses. We dont have any specific hotel recommendations for this event, but there are many options in the Lawrence or Topeka areas that are driving distance. Auditioning students are expected to stay with the group overnight in the high school. As always, call us with any questions you may have.<br>
 Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="/signupform" target ="blank">email mailing list at www.colts.org</a> to receive Colts information via email.<br>
Volunteers at camp generally gather at the end of breakfast in the kitchen area on Saturday at 9:00 am to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen or the check in table are always good places to start with questions about where to jump in.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>SUNDAY AFTERNOON PERFORMANCE</b><br>
                A performance including all participants of the weekend is held Sunday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. in the high school gymnasium. You will be amazed at the progress we make in just one short weekend.</p>

Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans please), and tennis shoes (no high tops, please). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Please bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the weekend. To speed up the check in process, it is recommended that you email a picture of yourself (think headshot or selfie) to <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last) and which audition camp you will be attending in the email. This picture is printed on your audition form so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. There will also be a camera at check in if you are unable to submit a picture ahead of time.<br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Please bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you do not have access to an instrument and will need one provided, please contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest: Trumpet, Mellophone, Baritone/Euphonium, or Tuba. You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude or excerpt you feel comfortable with. For the Sunday afternoon performance, please wear the audition t-shirt and jeans.<br>
                <br>
                Color Guard: Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), black pants or shorts and a black shirt for Sunday's performance, your own rifle and/or sabre (if you can), and knee pads (if you like). There is no need to purchase any special equipment for rehearsals. You will wear your audition t-shirt for most rehearsal segments through the weekend.<br>
                <br>
                Percussion: Please bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad. Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest: Battery, Cymbals, or Front Ensemble. Front ensemble students may, but are not required to, perform a short segment from a personal selection. Cymbal students should prepare a short musical and visual phrase of your choice. We will provide all instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group. Please wear the audition t-shirt and jeans for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
All positions in the corps are open. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 9:00 pm at the Five Flags Center. Bring all of your questions! We know you have plenty of them. A similar meeting will also take place at the December and January rehearsal weekends if you are unable to attend this month.<br>
Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out all about our program, meet the other parents and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and occasionally assist with some repair work or construction projects. We can always find something to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.<br>
Parents are welcome to stay overnight in designated rooms at the Five Flags Center with sleeping bags/air mattresses. If parents are interested in hotel accommodations, we recommend the <a href="https://www.holidayinn.com/hotels/us/en/dubuque/dbqia/hoteldetail" target= "blank">Holiday Inn</a> for this rehearsal, as it is attached to the Arena in which we are rehearsing. Please call 563-556-2000 and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate for $76 per night. For all events, we recommend the <a href="https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target= "blank">Hampton Inn</a> for your stay in Dubuque. Auditioning students are expected to stay with the group overnight in the arena. As always, call us with any questions you may have.<br>
Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="/signupform" target= "blank">email mailing list at www.colts.org</a> to receive Colts information via email.<br>
Volunteers at camp generally gather at the end of breakfast on Saturday at 9 am to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen or the check in table are always good places to start with questions about where to jump in.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>SUNDAY AFTERNOON PERFORMANCE</b><br>
                A performance including all participants of the weekend is held Sunday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. at the Five Flags Center. You will be amazed at the progress we make in just one short weekend.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
                <p><i>November 7, 2016</i></p>
                <p>The Colt Cadets are proud to announce the design team for the 2017 season. A combination of new and old faces, many of whom are alumni of the organization, will create a strong and dynamic team. The team will work closely with and be supported by Colt Cadets Director David Alford and Assistant Director Andrew Eaton. This season will also celebrate Colt Cadets' 50th anniversary.</p>
                <p>"I couldn't be more excited for the incredible leadership and talent we have on the Colt Cadets design team this year," said Colt Cadets Director David Alford. "Phil Snyder brings the right philosophy and approach to music education and programming that is proven through his years of brass instruction at the Colts. Terry White is an exceptional brass arranger and I'm thrilled he's returning with his successful career in education and composition. Alex Albertson promises to bring success and consistency to a talented percussion section. And, I couldn't be happier to have Mitchell Stolberg returning to the Colts Youth Organization, along with Jessica Dunkel. Their combined years of color guard and dance instruction will prove to be invaluable for the Colt Cadets color guard."</p>
                <p>"With this being the corps' 50th anniversary, I'm looking forward to working with this design team to create an educational and entertaining program," said Colt Cadets Assistant Director Andrew Eaton. "Seeing the growth in the corps over my past 10 seasons on staff has been truly rewarding, and I believe this team will be able to provide a strong foundation for the corps looking into the future. The combination of experienced and skilled designers, along with a high number of Colts alumni, will create a unique and powerful educational environment for the students."</p>
                <p>Leading the design team will be Program Coordinator and Visual Designer <b>Phil Snyder</b>. Phil is an alumnus of the Colts, having aged out on trumpet in 2004. He has been on brass staff with the Colts for several years since, most recently from 2014 to 2016. Phil is an active designer, adjudicator and band director in Minnesota.</p>
                <p>Returning to the Colt Cadets design team will be Brass Arranger <b>Terry White</b> and Percussion Arranger <b>Alex Albertson</b>. Terry has been the brass arranger for the Colt Cadets since 2012 and is excited to continue writing for the corps. He currently resides in Maine, where he is an active arranger, composer and performer for several groups in the area, including the Portland Jazz Orchestra. Alex Albertson is also an alumnus of the Colts, having aged out of the front ensemble in 2011. Alex has been on Colt Cadets staff since 2012, and is currently a music teacher at Logan-Magnolia Community Schools in Logan, Iowa. Alex will also be percussion caption head for the 2017 season.</p>
                <p>Color Guard Caption Head and Designer <b>Mitchell Stolberg</b> will lead the color guard with support from Color Guard Supervisor <b>Jessica Dunkel</b>. Both are alumni of the Colts color guard program. Mitchell is an adjunct dance professor at Rockford University and an active performer with the Bad Wolf Dance Theatre. Jessica is entering her ninth season on staff with the Colt Cadets and is currently a part-time technician with the Downers Grove South High School marching band.</p>

                <p><i>September 21, 2016</i></p>
                <p>The past month has been filled with many late nights and busy weekends as the Colts work to finish the demolition phase and move everything from the old downtown office to the new warehouse and office. Thank you to every parent, member, alum, and volunteer who has helped in the demolition and moving so far! The Colts are truly thankful to have such a wonderful support system.</p>
                <p>The sale of the Colts Center, located at 1101 Central Avenue, to the City of Dubuque will be complete very soon. The agreement to purchase of the Colts Center was the first step in a multi-million dollar expansion and remodeling of the <a href="https://www.mfcdbq.org" target= "blank">Multicultural Family Center</a>. The expansion will include additional meeting space, presentation areas, and office suites.</p>
                <p>The Colts are moving to 2300 Twin Valley Drive, former home of Key City Moving & Storage, in the Key West area of Dubuque. The new facility includes a warehouse, office space, and ample parking for all vehicles. For years, the Colts have leased or been given permission to park their vehicles on numerous lots around the city. The organization currently owns four motor coaches, two semi trailers and a tractor, five vans, and numerous small trailers. Within the warehouse, shelves will line the perimeter and provide space to store all equipment, souvenirs, surplus food, and archives in a secure and temperature controlled location. The office area will hold four offices, a boardroom, and two restrooms.</p>
				<p>Starting October 1, the Colts will begin the building phase to completely renovate the office and boardroom areas.</p>
				<p>You can view pictures of the moving and demolition phases HERE.</p>

      <p><i>August 29, 2016</i></p>
      			<p>Announcing our two drum majors for the 2017 season: Noah Perkins and Jack Riehl.</p>
                <p>Noah Perkins just finished his first season as drum major and fifth as a member of the Colts -- marching the other four on baritone. He is in his third year at the University of Iowa as a trombone performance and instrumental music education major. </p>
                <p>"My first season as drum major was very much a growth experience for me, and I'm looking forward to getting to return to the position as drum major as a more experienced and mature leader," said Noah. "It was an honor to stand in front of, and grow with, such an excellent ensemble. The whole Colts organization has been such a great family to me the past five years and I can't wait to see where the 2017 season takes us."</p>
                <p>Jack Riehl just finished his third year in the Colts front ensemble playing marimba. Other than playing in the Colts, he has also been a part of Westerville North Marching Band and Westerville North Indoor Ensemble. Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Jack now lives in Cincinnati getting his degree in medical sciences from the University of Cincinnati, which he hopes to use to go to medical school and become a pediatric surgeon. </p>
                <p>"Colts has been a family for me since my first season marching here," said Jack. "Everyone was so welcoming and I instantly found people that are still some of my greatest friends today. I'm so excited for the opportunity to become drum major so I will have the chance to repay the organization for everything they have done for me and push the Colts to a new level both on and off the field."</p>
                <p>Audition information for the 2017 season will be out soon! Make plans to audition at a camp and become a member of the 2017 Colts.</p>

                <p>The annual banquet has traditionally been held in Dubuque on Thanksgiving weekend but in recent years it's been more difficult for many members to attend.

                <p>Details for the evening are still being finalized but we plan to begin the evening around 6:00 PM with some social time and mingling before we get into the member awards and acknowledgements. </p>
                <p>Dinner for the annual banquet will be catered by <a href="https://www.citybbq.com/">City Barbeque</a>. An extremely generous Colts parent will be picking up the tab for our banquet meal and we cannot be more appreciative for the generosity and tasty treats!</p>
                <p>If you're planning to attend DCI Championships Week in Indianapolis, the Colts hotel block (which is likely long sold out) is at the Coutyard By Marriott in downtown Indianapolis. We have just a few tickets remaining for the shows in Lucas Oil Stadium. Contact <a href="mailto:jeff@colts.org">Jake</a> in the office for availability.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>June 6, 2016</i></p>
      			<p>The 240 members of the Colts and Colt Cadets will be practicing more than music on Saturday, June 11th, as they instead become experts at washing cars.</p>
                <p>Nineteen simultaneous locations will be staffed with members of both corps from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM for the annual Colts Car Wash fundraiser. Since inception of this program in 1985, over $350,000 has been raised for summer travel expenses of the Colts and Colt Cadets.</p>
                <p>Last year the groups washed nearly 800 cars and earned over $40,000 in donations and paid pledges. Proceeds from the car wash will be used for summer tour costs. Increased prices for diesel and food will be a real challenge this summer, and the car wash helps get the two groups down the road.</p>
                <p>The car wash is free, with donations accepted. There is no minimum donation expected.</p>
                <p>We would like to extend a big THANK YOU to our host sites! We would not be successful with this event without the warm welcome we receive from these businesses.</p>

      			<p>Not only are the members of the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps on the move as they prepare for the upcoming season, the Colts Youth Organization is making plans to move their offices later this summer. The Colts are working with the City of Dubuque on an agreement to purchase their building at 1101 Central Avenue. If the sale of their current facility becomes finalized, the Colts will move to 2300 Twin Valley Dr., former home of Key City Moving & Storage. While the two have agreed in principle on the City's acquisition, the sale does not become official until the city council takes action at their meeting on Monday, June 6th.</p>
                <p>"We are excited for both the future of the Colts and the City of Dubuque as they look to expand the Multicultural Family Center," said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. "The new Colts facility would offer much-needed additional storage, and the ability to finally park our fleet of vehicles on our own property."</p>
                <p>The summer tours of both the Colts and Colts Cadets require many vehicles to move the students and their instruments down the road. Both groups also have meals prepared by volunteers while on the road. For years, the Colts have leased or been given permission to park their vehicles on numerous lots around the city. The organization currently owns four motor coaches, two semi trailers and a tractor, four vans, and numerous small trailers. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, without a large banquet hall at the new facility the organization will no longer operate their three-nights-per-week bingo games that are run by the Colts Booster Club.</p>
                <p>"I played Colts bingo as a kid, so there is part of me that is sad we will no longer have a facility to operate our bingo," said MacFarlane.</p>
                <p>The Colts bingo, as well as other charitable bingos in the area, has been impacted by the popularity of the land-based casinos and, more recently, the smoking ban in 2008.</p>
                <p>Colts Bingo will host their final bingo on Sunday, June 5, 2016, at which both jackpot prizes will be awarded. Other than the guaranteed jackpots, the evening will be a regular session of bingo.</p>
                <p>Pending approval of their agreement with the City of Dubuque, the Colts plan to remodel the new property on Twin Valley Dr. before moving in following their 2016 summer tour. </p>
                <p>"Regarding our bingo, I would like to thank everyone who has ever played or volunteered at Colts bingo through the years," said MacFarlane. "There have been hundreds of bingo players these past decades who believed, and still believe, in the mission of the Colts Youth Organization and what we do for kids."</p>
                <p><i>"We use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life."</i> This simple mission drives the organization and ensures its continued success. Colts programs provide motivated young people an opportunity to participate in intensive, accelerated performing arts ensembles, and in the process learn life skills that allow them to grow as future leaders.</p>

Your car will be kept throughout the summer at our vehicle lot which is the site of a former bowling alley. The lot is not secured. (Please note: We prefer that you do not leave a car in Dubuque for the summer. If you have no other alternative, please contact Vicki in advance of the weekend. Please only leave your car in Dubuque if absolutely essential. <i>Although we do our best to keep everything safe, the Colts accept no responsibility for cars left in Dubuque.</i>) </p>
                
                <p>HINTS FOR THIS REHEARSAL<br>

<p>CAR WASH - CRITICAL! JUNE 11, 2016<br>
This is a critical project for us and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We expect you will collect a minimum of $175. Our goal is to wash 750 cars or more. Please do your share and please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>

<p>Remember, the car wash is an expectation of your membership, stated and agreed to on your membership contract. More importantly, we are only successful if we all contribute, and it beats the heck out of selling pizzas, magazines and other products. Please do your share and more. When everyone pitches in, like last year, we can make over $40,000!</p>

<p>Remember, you don't have to collect the pledges or donations. We can bill and collect from the office by mail when you turn in your form with supportive donors.</p>

<p>MEMBER JACKETS<br>
Payment must be made when the order is taken. Jacket prices are $110 (sizes XS-XXL), which includes the embroidery of your name and section.  </p>

Members and staff can purchase a 2016 Colts summer tour shirt -- ie: the "show shirt" -- for a discounted price of $12 (normally $18) THIS WEEKEND ONLY. All tour shirt sales after Memorial Day will be $18 for everyone. We will have ALL Colts merchandise available beginning Saturday evening at Roosevelt Middle School. </p>

                <p>This months camp start is different, so please read carefully. Please arrive at Washington Middle School between 7:00 pm and 7:15 pm to unload the trailer. We cannot enter the school until 9:00 pm, so rehearsal will begin outdoors. Please do not try to get into the building any earlier than 9:00 pm. If you must arrive earlier on Friday, please join us at the Colts Center (1101 Central Avenue) until the time we have school grounds permission (7:00 pm).</p>
                <p>We will start with a quick meeting for everyone at 7:50 pm. Sectionals will begin at 8:00 pm Friday outdoors, and we will move inside to continue sectionals at 9:00 pm. The camp will conclude by 3:00 pm Sunday. Please arrive at 7:30 pm on Friday to help unload. You can find directions to the school <a href="/directions.asp#wash">HERE</a>.</p>
                <p>While we will do some check in outdoors, the bulk of check in will happen at snack (11:00 pm in Washington Middle School). Paying in advance will speed up your check in process. First time attendees get a $25 discount by paying before the camp date. You can pay your camp fees through Wednesday 5:00 pm at the <a href="http://store.colts.org/Camp-Fees_c_28.html">Colts Store</a>.</p>
                <p>For first time 2016 season camp attendees, the cost of this rehearsal is $175, <i>($125 for returning members)</i>. If this is your second or more rehearsal for this season, then the cost is $60. This fee is collected at each camp and covers your meals, overnight accommodations, instruction, and materials. This fee does not apply toward summer tuition. </p>
                <p>NOTICE: The Member Handbook (aka Tour Survival Guide) and car wash information will be distributed soon. THE MEMBER HANDBOOK (Tour Survival Guide) will answer most of your questions about what to pack, what to bring, logistics and the like, especially for new members and new parents. We will email the information to all members and parents. Everyone needs to read the handbook in its entirety! The information will also be printable at www.colts.org. All members will be asked to submit a signed acknowledgment of the member handbook.</p>
                <p>Members, please double check with your parents to ensure they are checking the website and getting all of the information we provide as well! Please bring your own spandex for uniform fittings at this event. Brass and battery members should feel free to bring your favorite pillow case for your shako bag!

                <p><b>If you are auditioning, please make sure you are prepared with the details on the website.</b> </p>
                <p>The COLOR GUARD will be offsite much of the weekend for rehearsals. On Friday night, the guard will meet at Washington, but will bus to the National Guard Armory from 8:15 pm until 10:45 pm. On Saturday, the guard will depart for Hempstead High School, and use their gym from 9:00 am until 8:30 pm (meals 2 & 3 will be remote). For Sunday, we will utilize the Five Flags Center in downtown Dubuque from 8:45 am until 1:45 pm (sack lunch at Five Flags). </p>
                <p><a href="/rsvp.cfm">PLEASE RSVP TODAY</a> </p>

We need to know the date that you will be moving in for the summer.</i></p>
                <p>Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the facility. We also have arrangements for discounted rates at the Hampton Inn here in Dubuque.

<p><b>HINTS FOR THIS REHEARSAL</b><br>
1. Bring clothes for any weather (snow, rain or heat wave). You may be outside for much of the weekend, working on drill and music. Dont forget cold weather gear. You just never know. Right now there is an 80% chance of rain each day this weekend. Please plan accordingly!<br>
2. Two pairs of comfortable tennis shoes (no high tops). One pair is for wet and mud that will be taken off before entering the school if it rains or is wet outdoors.<br>
3. Athletic braces for any previous injuries or weaknesses. You will be on your feet a lot this weekend, so protect yourself against injury.<br>

<p><b>Be A Colts Booster!</b><br>
Help needed from parents, fans, and friends. We will be working frantically on uniform fitting this weekend and to sew more souvie flags. Of course, help in the kitchen is always necessary! We will also begin preparing the kitchen truck (cleaning, loading, painting, etc). Parents, please bring sewing machines, power tools, and work clothes.</p>
<p>You don't need to be a parent! What about Grandma? Or Grandpa's friend? You get the idea. The corps work can be fulfilling for the volunteers, too! Thank you for all of your support in advance!</p>

A great experience for your member is up to you! Volunteering is a great experience, too! We need help on the cook truck and by driving vans in the convoy.</p>
<p>We ask that members try to find someone to help tour for one week this summer. If not mom or dad, how about a friend or a family relative, band director or someone else you know. <i>Tour volunteers should be beyond marching age (22 or older).</i></p>
<p>Parents, when you visit the Colts on tour, please arrive to our housing site as early in the day as you can to give us a hand. When you come, please consider bringing fresh fruit or vegetables!</p>

You may order a member jacket online at the Colts Store. If you ORDER NOW and we are out of your size, we will plan to have your jacket available before tour departs after Colts Summer Premiere.</p>

<p><b>EARLY MOVE IN FOR GUARD AND BATTERY</b><br>
We will be staying at the Dubuque Armory again this season, and bussing to fields. Please plan on arriving around 6:00 pm on Sunday evening May 22, so we may begin rehearsal bright and early Monday morning, May 23. </p>

<p>If your parents are able to volunteer for a day or two during this time, we would be VERY EXCITED to have them with us! Please have them contact Vicki to help during this time.</p>

<p><b>MAY / CORNFIELD TOUR / AUGUST AIRLINE PLANS</b><br>
We can pick you up at the airport or bus station in Dubuque. If you need assistance getting here from another airport, please call us before booking flights. Rides from other local airports such as Moline (MLI) or Cedar Rapids (CID) can generally be accommodated.</p>

<p>To arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call 563-582-4872. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a>. (BTW...have you submitted an <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a> for camp? This is a must before EACH camp and move ins to confirm your attendance.)</p>

<p>For those who will be flying home after finals, please note: You should purchase a plane ticket home no earlier than 6:00 am on Sunday, August 14, from the Indianapolis Airport (IND). We will run a bus from the stadium to the Indianapolis Airport after finals early Sunday morning. A fun-filled overnight at the airport awaits you with about 2,000 other corps members!</p>

<p><b>CHAMPIONSHIPS / TICKETS</b><br>
There are a few tickets remaining in the Colts block for the Drum Corp International World Championships held in Indianapolis, IN on August 11-13. To purchase or find out additional information, contact Kevin at <a href="mailto:office@colts.org">office@colts.org</a>.</p>

<p><b>Personal Uniform Parts</b><br>
These parts have been added to your bill and were emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out at the Memorial Day camp. Each brass and battery member receive a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals also purchase gloves). Prices for Brass/Cymbals/DM will be $100; Battery $80 (no gloves), and front ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $125 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag and other necessary personal items.</p>

<p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 11, 2016</b><br>
This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>

<p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 11.</p>
<p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts.  When everyone does their share, we can make more than $40,000 in our one-day event! </p>
<p>Please plan, so that you can do your share. It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas and whatever else. Our <b>one and only fundraiser for members</b> does the same thing as many small ones. </p>
<p>The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel. It's extra important that we do well this year with what is happening in the world and with beef prices going crazy. </p>
<p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge of a penny per car total will end up being around $8. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to.  You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received for you. We then collect these payments through the office by mail. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory. </p>

<p>Learn More About The Colt Cadets:</p>

<p>Summer Membership in the Colt Cadets is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no audition to be a member, but students are expected to be strong team players with a desire to be great!</p>
<p>Our preseason rehearsals are approached as clinics, so that any young person can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to experience a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best. </p>
<p>During the summer the Colt Cadets will perform for more than 75,000 people in seven states. In 2016, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Last season marked the sixth consecutive year the Colt Cadets placed as DCI Open Class Finalists. For the full summer schedule, click <a href="/2015Calendar.pdf/">HERE</a></p>
<p>We can make a variety of summer schedules work! Many members are able to participate in other summer activities while performing with the Colt Cadets. If you have questions about your specific summer plans, do not hesitate to call or email, and feel free to bring your summer schedule to an open rehearsal. Our staff will provide more insight on how to balance your summer plans.</p>
<p>All instruments, uniforms, and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of their summer membership fees. But remember, all preseason rehearsals are FREE to attend. </p>
<p>Anyone unavailable for this event can still join us at one of our upcoming rehearsals in Dubuque. See a full list of our preseason rehearsals <a href="/cadets/calendar.cfm/">HERE</a> </p>
<p>Students who live exceptionally far away from Dubuque should contact either Matt <a href="mailto:matt@colts.org">matt@colts.org</a> or the Colts office (563-582-4872) to discuss how they can participate. </p>

      <p><i>April 18, 2016</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts are now accepting nominations for their Hall of Fame class of 2016! Any member of the public may nominate an individual for induction into the Colts Hall of Fame by submitting a letter describing the reasons their nominee should be considered, along with a brief description of the role and history of contributions that person has made to the Colts organization. <a href="/HOF_Nomination.pdf">CLICK HERE</a> for a description of the nomination process.</p>
                <p>The Hall of Fame was established in 1993 during the 30th anniversary celebration of the Colts. The award is the highest level of recognition given by the organization, and many of our founding fathers were the first to be enshrined. The Hall of Fame went dormant following our 40th anniversary but was reintroduced in 2015 to honor those who have provided distinguished service.</p>
                <p>In the days ahead, we will expand the recognition of the individuals currently included in the Hall of Fame by adding a brief biography and photograph for each. If you have photographs, anecdotes, or other information to add to Hall of Fame member biographies, please send them to: <a href="mailto:hof@colts.org">hof@colts.org</a>. You can view a full listing of all Colts Hall of Fame members <a href="/hof.asp">HERE</a>.</p>

Brass and battery members should wear a white shirt with black (or dark color) shorts or sweatpants that can be rolled up for visual rehearsal.</p>

<p>Brass: <b>Please bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, and gloves.</b> If you do not have access to an instrument and will need one provided, please contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest: Trumpet, Mellophone, Baritone/Euphonium, or Tuba. Students are strongly encouraged to prepare a personal selection on any instrument of choice. These selections may include any etude or solo, from any source, but should demonstrate your best musical and technical abilities. You are welcome to play your primary instrument for your personal selection (French horn, trombone, clarinet, etc). Please bring a black t-shirt and jeans for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p>
 
<p>Color Guard: Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), black pants or shorts and a black shirt for Sunday's performance, your own rifle and/or sabre (if you can), and knee pads (if you like). There is no need to purchase any special equipment for rehearsals.</p>
 
<p>Percussion: Please bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad. Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest: Battery, Cymbals, or Front Ensemble. Snare, tenor, and front ensemble students should prepare a short solo (1-2 minutes) for your individual audition in addition to the exercises found in the technique packet. Cymbal students are asked to perform a short phrase of your own choice musically and visually, in addition to the musical excerpt included in the cymbal packet. Individual solos and selections should best demonstrate your musical and technical abilities. Please bring a black t-shirt and jeans for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p>

					<p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
We can pick you up and drop you off at the airport or bus station in Dubuque at any time over the weekend. If you need assistance getting here from another airport, please call us BEFORE booking any flights. Rides from other local airports such as Moline (MLI) or Cedar Rapids (CID) can generally be accommodated.</p>
<p>If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call 563-582-4872. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a>.</p>

					<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
There are positions available in every section of the corps. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.</p>
<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
<p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>

					<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.</p>
<p>If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>

					<p><b>EMAIL AND WEBSITE</b><br>
Make sure you sign onto the <a href="/signupform">email distribution list</a> with your current email address, and check your email frequently! Encourage your parents to sign up for the membership emailings, too. </p>
<p>Again, please form a habit of checking the website immediately prior to departing on your travel to Dubuque. Any changes or updates relative to camp will be posted here first.</p>

					<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 9:45 pm in a room at the facility. Bring all of your questions! We know you have plenty of them. </p>

<p>Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you help provide our students the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.</p>

<p>Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and occasionally assist with some repair work. We can always find something to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.</p>

<p>Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href= "https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" >Hampton Inn</a>  here in Dubuque. Please ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.</p>

<p>Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="/signupform">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.</p>
 
<p>All parents and volunteers are automatically Colts Boosters! Plan on gathering Saturday morning at the end of breakfast (9 am) to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places ask about where you can help.</p>

				<p><b>Drum Corps Medical Project</b><br>
7-9 pm Friday night we will have medical pre-screenings for anyone with a contract that is: 18 or older OR under the age of 18 with a parent present.</p>

<p>Learn More About The Colt Cadets:</p>

<p>Summer Membership in the Colt Cadets is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no audition to be a member, but students are expected to be strong team players with a desire to be great!</p>

<p>During the summer the Colt Cadets will perform for more than 75,000 people in seven states. In 2016, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Last season marked the sixth consecutive year the Colt Cadets placed as DCI Open Class Finalists. For the full summer schedule, click <a href="/cadets/2015Calendar.pdf/">HERE</a></p>
<p>We can make a variety of summer schedules work! Many members are able to participate in other summer activities while performing with the Colt Cadets.

Our staff will provide more insight on how to balance your summer plans.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">An Interview With Howard Weinstein</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>February 12, 2016</i></p>
      			<p>Dubuque Colts Media recently had an opportunity to sit down with new Colts Program Coordinator Howard Weinstein to get some unique perspectives from the long-time DCI vet. Howard was corps director for the Boston Crusaders from 1999-2007 where he also coordinated the field show. In 2009, he joined the Blue Stars as their corps director and continued through the 2011 season. Enjoy this glimpse into what's ahead for the Colts.
</p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>So you had a few years on the outside of DCI looking in. Why was it the right time to get back involved?</i>
  </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b> To be honest, I am not getting any younger. <i>(smiling)</i> I have been involved in the drum corps activity since 1983, first as a performer, then as an instructor, and then as a program coordinator and caption head, so I have been blessed to have been involved in the activity in some way, shape or form for a good part of my life. When I left the Blue Stars a few years ago, it was because I had to take some time to set my life up for my future. This was to set it up personally, professionally, and stabilize myself so that I could eventually retire. Now, I am at a place in my life where I felt I was able to get back involved, not at the level I was before, but in a way that I could again have an impact on an organization, and the activity, and this seemed to be the perfect time.
	  </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>We assume there was more than one corps interested in having Howard Weinstein on their staff. How did you choose to work in Dubuque, Iowa?</i>
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b> Since I have left the activity, I would make it a point to go to the Atlanta DCI Regional and watch each and every corps. Watching the Colts...the organization seemed like a drum corps that would align with my skills, talent and influence. My niche in the activity has been working with performance ensembles and helping them to progress forward both on and off the field, and I really felt that my involvement with the Colts had the potential to be a win-win, giving me a fantastic opportunity to work with the group to continue their legacy in the drum corps activity, and the Colts organization would be able to benefit from my years of leadership, design and accomplishment.
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>You've been with the group for a few months now. Have you found anything to be unique to the Colts organization?</i>
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b> Well, as you know, the drum corps activity is a lot of the same from organization to organization. That is evident to me, with the Colts being my third legacy organization I have had the honor to work with. I think the biggest difference I have found with the Colts has been the fact that they have the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps within their organization, as well. I find it to be a tremendous positive for several reasons. For example, it's very special when you see members that are coming up into the Colts that have come through the younger group. It also gives us a place to recommend auditionees that are not quite ready for the World Class experience, where they can train, grow and become stronger performers.  
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>The last corps you worked for was in La Crosse, Wisconsin  the smallest market to sponsor a DCI World Class drum corps. Are there any special challenges  or possibly advantages  to working in the second smallest market...Dubuque?</i>
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b> Absolutely, with both corps. The challenge is the limitation of travel in and out of a major metropolitan marketplace. My last organization shifted our winter program to the Indianapolis marketplace for this very reason. We still had everything else in La Crosse, but the move made it easier for members and staff to travel in and out. It also made it financially easier on the organization for wide range of reasons.
      			  The advantage of both groups being in a smaller market is the area being aware and supportive of the drum corps being in their community. This is a benefit for sponsorships and fundraisers throughout the year for the corps, as well as individual members.
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>Is there anything that makes programming the Colts show different from the other two groups you worked with? Or is a drum corps show pretty much the same regardless of the corps uniform, tradition or location?</i> 
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b> I am actually finding programming for the Colts extremely limitless. This is based on the history of the corps, and shows they have done in the past. Often, corps will be stuck in a realm of classical, or jazz, etc.  I have not found this with the Colts. The uniform, history, and area give our design team an open landscape, where we can go in any direction both musically and visually.
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>You also program shows for a variety of high school bands, and currently work with the 2014 Bands of America Grand National Champion Tarpon Springs. Aside from no woodwinds, what is the biggest difference between programming for DCI vs. BOA?</i>
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b> I think the biggest difference between designing for DCI verses BOA would be that the make-up of the audiences are different. Think about it, the BOA audiences, that are live in the stands, are about 75% parents of the students on the field, and other bands competing. This is somewhat of a captive audience, and allows the bands to take a great deal of risks, and move in a lot of directions, and for the most part, the audience is going to be pretty supportive. Don't get me wrong, as the General Effect sheets for both activities are written very similar, so we take a lot of the same approaches when it comes to creating effects and synchronizing the music to visual elements of the show.  
      			  I think the big difference with DCI is maybe with the exception of finals week, the majority of the audience are strictly drum corps fans, and people that have marched in the past. This is especially true at Tour Event Partner shows. At the DCI Regional events, there are a lot of high school bands in attendance, but I think you see the difference of the average makeup of the viewers. For this reason, I feel there is a huge responsibility that the show truly connects with audiences from multiple generations. This has also been encouraged from the adjudication community, as the entertainment value is strongly considered when the group is judged.
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>Do you have a long-term vision for the Colts? Or are you just working to get the 2016 program put together, and not get wrapped up in the future?</i>
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b> Currently, with it being my first year with the organization, my main focus has been on the 2016 field show, coordinating and leading the staff  making sure that we are all working in a congruent fashion with aligned goals and aspirations, and implementing a student leadership program. Beyond that, I am working to get to know as many people as possible from this very special organization including alumni, board members, and the many volunteers and supporters that make this whole thing happen.
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>Last question...anything you would like to share about what we'll see from the Colts in 2016?</i>
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>HW:</b>  Look for the 2016 Colts to be entertaining, audience-connecting, and endearing. The show will be elegant, sophisticated and moving. I think the DCI community will really like us.
   			    </p>
      			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>Thank you, Howard! We certainly look forward to the years ahead.</i>

					<p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
We can pick you up and drop you off at the airport or bus station in Dubuque at any time over the weekend. If you need assistance getting here from another airport, please call us BEFORE booking any flights. Rides from other local airports such as Moline (MLI) or Cedar Rapids (CID) can generally be accommodated.</p>
<p>If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call 563-582-4872. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a>.</p>

					<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
There are positions available in every section of the corps. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.</p>
<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
<p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>

					<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.</p>
<p>If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>

					<p><b>EMAIL AND WEBSITE</b><br>
Make sure you sign onto the <a href="/signupform">email distribution list</a> with your current email address, and check your email frequently! Encourage your parents to sign up for the membership emailings, too. </p>

					<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 9:45 pm in a room at the facility. Bring all of your questions! We know you have plenty of them. </p>

<p>Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you help provide our students the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.</p>

<p>Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and occasionally assist with some repair work. We can always find something to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.</p>

<p>Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href= "https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" >Hampton Inn</a>  here in Dubuque. Please ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.</p>

<p>Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="/signupform">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.</p>
 
<p>All parents and volunteers are automatically Colts Boosters! Plan on gathering Saturday morning at the end of breakfast (9 am) to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places ask about where you can help.</p>

				<p><b>Drum Corps Medical Project</b><br>
7-9 pm Friday night we will have medical pre-screenings for anyone with a contract that is: 18 or older OR under the age of 18 with a parent present.</p>

In 2016, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Last season the Colt Cadets'  sixth consecutive year as DCI Open Class Finalists.</p>
                <p>All instruments, uniforms, and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of their summer membership fees.</p>
                <p>Anyone unavailable for the kickoff event may attend our next scheduled rehearsal on February 28th, which will also be held from 1:00-5:00 pm at Washington Middle School. Students who live exceptionally far away from Dubuque should contact either <a href="mailto:matt@colts.org">Matt</a> or the Colts office (563-582-4872) to discuss how they can participate.</p>

Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest: Trumpet, Mellophone, Baritone/Euphonium, or Tuba. Students are strongly encouraged to prepare a personal selection on any instrument of choice. These selections may include any etude or solo, from any source, but should demonstrate your best musical and technical abilities. You are welcome to play your primary instrument for your personal selection (French horn, trombone, clarinet, etc). Please bring a black t-shirt and jeans for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p>
 
<p>Color Guard: Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), black pants or shorts and a black shirt for Sunday's performance, your own rifle and/or sabre (if you can), and knee pads (if you like). There is no need to purchase any special equipment for rehearsals.</p>

Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest: Battery, Cymbals, or Front Ensemble. Snare, tenor, and front ensemble students should prepare a short solo (1-2 minutes) for your individual audition in addition to the exercises found in the technique packet. Cymbal students are asked to perform a short phrase of your own choice musically and visually, in addition to the musical excerpt included in the cymbal packet. Individual solos and selections should best demonstrate your musical and technical abilities. Please bring a black t-shirt and jeans for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p>

					<p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
We can pick you up and drop you off at the airport or bus station in Dubuque at any time over the weekend. If you need assistance getting here from another airport, please call us BEFORE booking any flights. Rides from other local airports such as Moline (MLI) or Cedar Rapids (CID) can generally be accommodated.</p>
<p>If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call 563-582-4872. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a>.</p>

					<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
There are positions available in every section of the corps. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.</p>
<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
<p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>

					<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="/rsvp.cfm">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.</p>
<p>If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>

					<p><b>EMAIL AND WEBSITE</b><br>
Make sure you sign onto the <a href="/signupform">email distribution list</a> with your current email address, and check your email frequently! Encourage your parents to sign up for the membership emailings, too. </p>
<p>Again, please form a habit of checking the website immediately prior to departing on your travel to Dubuque. Any changes or updates relative to camp will be posted here first.</p>

					<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 9:45 pm in a room at the facility. Bring all of your questions! We know you have plenty of them. </p>

<p>Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you help provide our students the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.</p>

<p>Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and occasionally assist with some repair work. We can always find something to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.</p>

<p>Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href= "https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" >Hampton Inn</a>  here in Dubuque. Please ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.</p>

<p>Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="/signupform">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.</p>
 
<p>All parents and volunteers are automatically Colts Boosters! Plan on gathering Saturday morning at the end of breakfast (9 am) to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places ask about where you can help.</p>

				<p><b>Drum Corps Medical Project</b><br>
7-9 pm Friday night we will have medical pre-screenings for anyone with a contract that is: 18 or older OR under the age of 18 with a parent present.</p>
