                <p><i>December 31, 2018</i></p>
                
                <p><p>The January San Antonio rehearsal and audition for the 2019 Colts will be held Sunday, January 6, on the Recreation Fields on the campus of The University of Texas at San Antonio. The address is 1 UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+University+of+Texas+at+San+Antonio/@29.5833361,-98.6232785,957m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x865c667dd6657fdd:0x24e55c903c3a270c!8m2!3d29.5830443!4d-98.6196555" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a Google map to the facility. <a href="/documents/2019_sanantonio_camp_parking.pdf"target="_blank">Click here for specific on-campus</a> location and parking directions.</p>
                <p>The cost for your first rehearsal is $175 (or $125 for returning members), which includes all audition and application fees. <strong><a href="https://store.colts.org/collections/camp-fees" target="_blank">Pay the fees online for your first camp in advance and SAVE $25</a></strong>. <em>Deadline for advance payment discount for the camps is the Monday immediately before a camp at 11:00 p.m.</em> This fee covers the cost of your audition and the event and does not apply toward your summer tuition.</p>
                <p><b>Always check <a href="/">colts.org</a> before leaving for camp for any last-minute updates!</b></p>
                <p>Registration will begin at 8:15 a.m. and rehearsal begins at 9:00 a.m., and will conclude at 5:00 p.m. on Sunday. Plan on arriving at 8:15 a.m. to register. New students are welcome to attend!</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
                The Colts do not provide transportation to or from the San Antonio airport for this event. The school is only about 13 miles from the San Antonio International Airport, so services like UBER, Lyft, or taxi should be available and relatively inexpensive. You should still include all flight details on your RSVP. If you need help finding a ride to camp please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can also let us know if you have extra room or if you need assistance on your <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a>. </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>PARKING</b><br>
                Parking is available on campus throughout the day. You will be emailed a map with parking directions before the camp.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>CAMP PAPERWORK</b><br>
                Prior to camp, you will be expected to turn in:<br>
                <ul>
					<li><a href="/rsvp" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. Regardless of your plans, submit an RSVP so we can keep you up to date. Be sure to include all necessary flight and travel information in the RSVP. If you need a ride from the airport, you will be notified by the Thursday immediately before the camp who will be picking you up. The RSVP should be submitted each month by interested students.</li>
					<li><a href="/memberapp" target="_blank">Member Application</a>. Submit your application in advance to save time at check in. All auditioning students <b>must</b> submit a member application. The application only needs to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes</li>
                    <li>Email a headshot of yourself to <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last), section, and which audition camp you are attending. This picture is added to your audition file so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. This picture must be submitted before the camp starts and is required of all attending. Make sure the image is clear, well lit, and contains your whole face. And, as great as your sunglasses or Snapchat filters may look, they don't belong in your headshot.</li>
				</ul>
                When you arrive to check in on Sunday, bring with you:<br>
                <ul>
                	<li><a href="/documents/MedicalForm2019.pdf" target="_blank">Colts Medical History Form</a>. This form is <b>required</b> in order to audition. The medical form also provides permission to participate in our activities. Students 18 or older may sign their own medical form. Any student 17 or younger must have a parent or guardian signature to participate. Medical forms only need to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes. Be sure to complete both sides!</li>
                </ul>
                <b>If this is your second camp, you do not need to submit an application, medical history form, or headshot (unless your information has changed!). However, you will still need to submit an <a href="/rsvp" target="_blank">RSVP</a> for this camp.</b></p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the day. <b>Don't forget to bring a water bottle!</b><br>
                <br>
                Percussion: Bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad. Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest. Front ensemble students are expected to perform a short segment of a personal selection for the individual audition. We ask that you provide your own sticks, and/or mallets, as well as a practice pad. We will provide all other instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
All positions in the percussion section are open. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly.</p>
				<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, it is critical to attend the January 18 - 20 camp in Dubuque to be considered for membership.</p>
                <p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else. You can pay your fees by cash or check, or by card online at the <a href="https://store.colts.org/collections/summer-fees" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the camp is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting for parents will be held Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the day.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the camp. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>

                <p><i>December 14, 2018</i></p>
                
                <p>The Colt Cadets are excited to announce a new leadership team for the 2019 season. <b>Andrew Eaton</b> will serve as <i>Corps Director</i> and provide the organizational and structural foundation to position the corps for success. Andrew will be the group's liaison with Drum Corps International, and he will also work with the Colt Cadets design team, where he served as program coordinator during the 2013 and 2014 seasons. <strong>Alex Albertson</strong> will be <em>Program Director</em> for the Colt Cadets. Alex will lead the design team and be responsible for the educational oversight of the Colt Cadets staff. He will continue to supervise the percussion section, which he has led as percussion caption head since 2015. <strong>Rich Waddington</strong> joined the 2018 Colt Cadets staff as <em>Tour Director</em> and will continue in that role in 2019. Rich will work with the volunteers, make sure the students are well nourished, and lead the corps down the road as efficiently as possible. The trio will provide the organization with a greater division of duties and a heightened focus on student success.</p>
                <p>Providing support in the office, <strong>Megan Hobbs</strong> recently became a full-time employee, serving as accountant for the Colts Youth Organization, along with her continued role as front ensemble instructor with the Colt Cadets. Megan will support the Colt Cadets leadership team from the office, assist with recruiting and front ensemble instruction in the offseason, and also spend time on the road teaching the Colt Cadets in the summer.</p>
                <p>Director of Youth Programs Vicki MacFarlane is excited about the opportunity to work with the team. "The strength of this combination is sure to serve the corps well. The experience and leadership of each individual is only going to be magnified in this group effort," said Vicki. "Andy has been with us for over a decade, Alex has been a mainstay on Colt Cadets staff since aging out of the Colts in 2011, and Rich is an incredible band director. This announcement is exciting for us to make now, but this team's heart, focus, drive, and dedication has been present since the end of the 2018 season."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Andrew Eaton</b> is entering his twelfth year with the Colts organization. He has filled various roles during his time with the Colts, including instructional staff, program coordinator, and assistant corps director for the Colt Cadets. Based in the Chicago suburbs, Andrew has worked in brass repair in one of the nation's largest music shops and is currently the head of brass repair. He has taught marching band with Lake Central High School in St. John, Indiana, Center Grove High School in Greenwood, Indiana, Clay City High School in Clay City, Indiana, and Lincoln-Way Marching Band in New Lenox, Illinois. Read Andrew's full bio <a href="/people-staff-admin" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>"For me, this really is a dream team to work with," said Andrew Eaton. "The experience, skills, and knowledge Alex and Rich bring to the table truly are one-of-a-kind, and I know they have the care and success of the members as their top priority. I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with the staff, students, and volunteers at Colt Cadets, and I think this will be another incredible season for the corps."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Alex Albertson</b> is entering his ninth year with the Colts organization. After aging out with the Colts in the front ensemble in 2011, Alex began working with the Colt Cadets and has served as instructor, percussion arranger, and percussion caption head. Alex is currently a music teacher at Logan-Magnolia Community Schools in Logan, Iowa, as well as director and designer for Railmen Indoor Percussion, based in Omaha, Nebraska. Read Alex's full bio <a href="/people-staff-cadets#design" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>"I am excited to work alongside Rich and Andy, two of the most driven people I have had the pleasure to meet in this wonderful activity," said Alex. "To play a part in continuing to provide a quality experience for young performers is a dream come true, and I cannot wait to formally begin the 2019 season!"</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Rich Waddington</b> is entering his second year with the Colts organization. Rich is currently the band director at Oskaloosa High School in Oskaloosa, Iowa. Under his leadership, the concert band, jazz band, and marching band have enjoyed considerable success in various competitions throughout the state. Initially a parent and volunteer, Rich quickly assumed the role of tour director in the 2018 season and is looking forward to returning in 2019. Read Rich's full bio <a href="/people-staff-cadets#tour" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>"My first experience with the drum corps activity and the Colts organization was incredible, and I’m looking forward to another great season!" said Rich. "The entire staff of the Colts and Colt Cadets are top notch and so much fun to work with. I’m honored to be part of this amazing organization and look forward to more great experiences for my family and I!"</p> 
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>"Alex, Andy, and Rich were a driving force for the Colt Cadets last summer. I'm excited for the students, parents, and teaching staff to continue the momentum from last season and experience another great summer in the long history of the Colt Cadets program," said Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Colt Cadets will begin rehearsals in February, but students interested in being a part of the Colt Cadets are encouraged to attend a Colts rehearsal weekend for experience.

                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Students stay overnight in the arena on the floor, as you will all summer. Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans), and tennis shoes (no high tops). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the weekend. <b>Don't forget to bring a water bottle!</b><br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you have absolutely no access to an instrument and need one provided, contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest. You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude, or excerpt you feel comfortable with. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group<br>
                <br>
                Percussion: Bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad. Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest. Cymbal should prepare a short phrase of your own choice musically and visually, in addition to the cymbal packet. Front ensemble students are expected to perform a short segment of a personal selection for the individual audition. We ask that you provide your own marching cymbals, sticks, and/or mallets, as well as a practice pad. We will provide all other instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
All positions in the corps are open. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly. Recall auditions can be scheduled three weeks after your initial audition at one of our events. Attend early and attend often for your best chance at a position in the Colts.</p>
				<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
                <p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else. You can pay your fees by cash or check, or by card online at the <a href="https://store.colts.org/collections/summer-fees" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 p.m. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend. If you arrive at a random time throughout the weekend, the kitchen or check in table are great places to start with questions anytime you visit about where you can help.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
		<br>
		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work or construction projects at the corps warehouse. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand!<br>
        <br>
        Parents are welcome to stay overnight in designated rooms at the Five Flags Center with sleeping bags and air mattresses.

                <p>Rehearsals will continue in February for brass in Dubuque. <b>All members will be expected to attend the April 26 - 28, 2019 rehearsal in Dubuque.</b></p>
                
                <p> After your first rehearsal, you will most likely receive a "recall" to a second audition so we can observe your growth and commitment. Students can begin attending their recall audition three weeks after their initial audition. Contracts are offered starting at our first event, and we intend to have our roster set (except color guard) after the January camp in Dubuque. Students who show up earlier have a higher chance of becoming a member of the Colts than students who wait until one of our later events.</p>
                <p>Three-day events typically begin with check-in and unloading at 6:00 p.m. on Friday and conclude around 4:00 p.m. on Sunday. One-day events typically start with check-in and unloading at 8:00 a.m. and conclude around 6:00 p.m. The cost for your first audition is $175 (or $125 for returning members), which includes all audition materials and application fees. Each subsequent event you attend is $60. Pay the fees for your first audition in advance and SAVE $25. <a href="https://store.colts.org/collections/camp-fees" target="_blank">PAY ONLINE HERE</a>. The deadline for advance payment is Monday immediately prior to each audition. These fees cover the cost of rehearsals and do not apply to summer tuition.</p>
                <p>Attendance at monthly camps is critical to the success of the drum corps and your success as a performer. When a student is offered membership in the Colts, attendance at events is expected. Legitimate conflicts (i.e. school events) are excused, provided you communicate in advance. Priority for positions is given to students who attend the earlier events. You can email <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> with individual questions.</p> 
                <p>You can view our <a href="/documents/ColtsMemberInfo_2019.pdf" target="_blank">2019 Membership Brochure</a> online. This packet contains information about the Colts, the audition process, and the 2019 season. You can find our <a href="/schedule-preseason" target="_blank">2019 Preseason Schedule</a> online as well. Don't forget to submit a <a href="/memberapp" target="_blank">Member Application</a> for 2019 as well!</p>
                <p>A rehearsal and audition is more than just an audition. You'll fully participate throughout each day and perform at the end as part of the Colts. The events are designed to give you the full drum corps experience. If you need help finding a ride, email <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>.

These educators care deeply about the success of the individual students, as well as the organization as a whole. I'm also looking forward to working with Don Click. While a new face to our organization, he has familiarity with a lot of our staff, and no doubt that will translate to many successes. The collaborative efforts between our team members — caption heads, technicians, and designers — will allow us to fine tune our overall experience and program for 2019.</p>

                <p><i>August 15, 2018</i></p>
                <p>The Colts and Colt Cadets concluded their 2018 seasons with performances in the Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis the weekend of August 9 - 11. The Colt Cadets finished 13th at the DCI Open Class Championships in Michigan City on Monday, and ended their season with a score of 61.800 Thursday morning in Lucas Oil Stadium. The Colts made a strong charge at the end of the season, being featured on their sixth consecutive “Big, Loud, and Live” broadcast on Thursday, August 9. The Colts ended their season with a jump into 14th with a score of 84.612 on Friday, August 10. The crowd reaction to both performances in Lucas Oil was truly one of a kind, with audiences leaping to their feet well before the end of the show.</p>
                <p>Both corps wrapped up their competitive seasons and dismissed from Ball State University on Saturday, August 11. The end of season wrap up for both corps included speeches from all caption heads, both corps directors, playing of the corps song, and, for Colts, speeches from its 29 age outs.</p>
                <p>The Colts media team was hard at work throughout the summer, documenting every move, note, rim shot, and catch on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dcicolts/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dcicolts" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dcicolts/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. Be sure to check out the great pictures and videos!</p>
                <p>This season for the Colts continued to build on successes from the previous year, which much of the design and instructional team, as well as membership, returning. The Colts were able to provide access to the activity to a higher number of students this year by holding auditions in St. Louis, San Antonio, Tampa, and Miami, as well as in Dubuque. The corps production, <b>True Believer</b>, was a fan favorite throughout the summer - every night the audience was on their feet by the end of the show. The Colts Cymbal Line competed in the annual Drum Corps International Performer’s Showcase with their original composition, <i>Unplugged</i>. The cymbal line received first place this year, winning the gold medal for the first time since 2006. The four cymbal players were recognized Friday night during the scholarship, awards, and recognition portion of the DCI Semifinals event.</p>
                <!-- <img src="/img/news/cc2018.jpg" width="500" height="" alt="Colt Cadets 2018" class="alignright imageborder"> -->
                <p>The Colt Cadets also enjoyed similar retention to the Colts on all levels, with many of their instructors, designers, and members returning for another year. The corps program, <b>Moderne</b>, was also a fan favorite, with many commenting it was the strongest corps they’ve seen from the Colt Cadets in several years. Colt Cadets also adapted a new tour model this year, spending more time "on the road" to give the members a fuller drum corps experience.</p>

                <p>The organization as a whole also had many successes throughout the season. Winter saw continued work on the new corps offices, with major progress being made on the last phase of the remodel. Now that summer is done, finishing touches can be added and the project will wrap up this off-season. This spring, the Colts received a Cultural Leadership Partner Operating Support Grant from the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. The organization received the maximum allowable grant award of $20,000 per year. Read more about the Cultural Leadership grant <a href="/2018_244" target="_blank">here</a>. June and July featured several great events organized by the Alumni Steering Committee that brought together alumni to celebrate the corps 55th anniversary season. These included a social gathering after Summer Premiere and a tailgate before the home show, Music On The March. Vicki MacFarlane, Colts Director, was recognized with two awards for her service and dedication to the Colts and the drum corps activity. In April, she was recognized by the Women’s Leadership Network of Dubuque with a <a href="/2018_231" target="_blank">Women Of Achievement Award</a>. During DCI World Championships, she was the recipient of the <a href="/2018_246" target="_blank">George Bonfiglio Chairperson’s Award</a>. Also at the DCI World Championships, the Colts-sponsored event Tournament of Drums, held annually in early August in Cedar Rapids, was recognized as Open Class Event Of The Year for the third year in a row. Finally, the Colts inducted eight new individuals to the Colts Hall Of Fame. You can read more about the achievements and contributions of these individuals to the Colts <a href="/2018_242" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Of course, this season, and this activity, could not have happened without the help, dedication, passion, and love from our many parents and volunteers. A huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to anyone and everyone who helped throughout the season, whether cooking, driving, sewing uniforms, or anything else that helps both drum corps move down the road. The Colts and Colt Cadets appreciate you so much and cannot thank you enough. Similarly, a huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to all of the incredible donors, sponsors, and endorsers who continue to believe in and support the mission of the Colts Youth Organization.</p>
                <p>The next few weeks will be a time to relax, reflect, and unpack from this season, but things are already moving into place for 2019. This year’s 55th anniversary season allowed the organization to connect with its alumni and history in new ways, while also setting the stage for the next 55 years of excellence.

                <p><i>August 13, 2018</i></p>
                <p>At this year’s Drum Corps International World Championships, Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane was recognized with the George Bonfiglio Chairperson’s Award. Now in its seventh year of being awarded, the Bonfiglio award is given annually to a person who has demonstrated extraordinary leadership, service, and effort on behalf of Drum Corps International. The recipient of the award is selected by the chair of the DCI Board of Directors, Kathy Black, and the DCI Executive Director, Dan Acheson.</p>
                <p>"What a mix of emotions! I am beyond honored, humbled, proud, and appreciative ... all those sorts of feelings," said Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane. "It's always great to have the Colts in the headlines, and this award is particularly special coming off such a fantastic season. This was by far my favorite summer to date, and I look forward to many more! An extra thanks to Kathy Black and Dan Acheson, who are amazing leaders in our activity."</p>
                <p>Vicki was a member of the Colts in 1994 and 1995 as a baritone player. After a few years teaching band in eastern Iowa, Vicki began volunteering with the Colts. This led to a teaching position with Colt Cadets in 2001, and then being asked to be the Colt Cadets director for the 2002 season. The corps in 2001 had 18 members, but by 2012 had over 75 members and was a perennial Open Class finalist. While director of Colt Cadets, Vicki also served as chair of Drum Corps International’s Open Class Advisory Committee for several years. For the 2013 season, Vicki became the director of the Colts, and just finished her sixth season as director. In addition, she serves as director of youth programs for the Colts Youth Organization and is a member of the <a href="https://www.dci.org/news/dci-launches-in-step-women-in-dci-initiative" target="_blank">IN STEP: Women In DCI</a> initiative. Vicki is currently the only female World Class corps director.</p>
                <p>"I admire Vicki's focus on education, and her prior service as Open Class liaison demonstrated her commitment to nurture and grow the activity," said DCI Board Chair Kathy Black. "As the only woman currently serving as a World Class corps director, she is a role model in the marching arts. And her energy and enthusiasm is an inspiration!"</p>
                <p>George Bonfiglio was the founder and longtime director of the 27th Lancers, as well as one of the “founding fathers” of Drum Corps International. Bonfiglio served as the first chair of the DCI Board of Directors and was a driving force behind the growth and increased prominence of drum corps in the marching arts from the 1970s through the 2010s. Bonfiglio was inducted as part of the Drum Corps International Hall of Fame Class of 1985. You can read more about Bonfiglio and his contributions to the drum corps activity <a href="https://www.dci.org/static/george-bonfiglio-dci-hall-of-fame" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Tom Lizotte, long time staff member for both Colts and Colt Cadets, worked with George Bonfiglio at the 27th Lancers in the 1980s. He was a close friend of Bonfiglio's, and is a close friend and mentor of Vicki's. He has been involved in the drum corps activity since 1977 and has seen many transformations in the leadership in the activity.</p> 
                <p>"It is totally appropriate that Vicki be given the Bonfiglio award, in that they share many important qualities," Tom said. "Their personal styles are very different, but they both are passionate, achievement-driven people who value family and drum corps as an extended family. They understand the human element of the activity. Both are can-do people for whom no task is too small. I have vivid memories of George digging into an engine at one of the Lancers' (frequent) bus breakdowns, and a usual sight is Vicki pitching in hauling props or doing whatever is necessary to renovate the corps hall. Both have high expectations and support good teaching. This award being given to Vicki is also appropriate given a bit of Lancer history. In 1986, I was brass caption head. I wanted to bring in a former North Star/Cadet mellophone player, Michelle Ledoux, as my head tech. With the exception of Sandra Opie, female brass instructors didn't exist back then in drum corps. Bonfiglio was all for us bringing Michelle on board, and he strongly supported her work. It was visionary and smart. When it came time to speak to the horn line before the performance we knew deep down would be the corps' last-ever, he deferred to Michelle. The path to recognition for women in this activity has been too long and too slow. George Bonfiglio was an early leader in hiring Michelle and making his daughter Denise program coordinator, and Vicki is carrying that torch. Very ftting."</p>

		</div>
	</div>
                <p><i>August 5, 2018</i></p>
				
				<p>The Colts Youth Organization was recently honored to receive a Cultural Leadership Partner Operating Support Grant from the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. The organization received the maximum allowable grant award of $20,000 per year.</p>
				<p>Cultural Leadership Partners demonstrate their investment in a rich cultural environment that improves the quality of life for all Iowans. Partners are selected every three years and receive grant funds to support operating costs throughout the three-year cycle. The Colts were selected because of their exemplary record of programming, managerial excellence and community service on a year-round basis to the citizens of Iowa.</p>
				<p>"These grants are catalysts that can spark cultural and economic growth in historic downtowns, concert halls and, possibly, the studio of a future Grant Wood," said Chris Kramer, acting director of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. "We're proud to help Iowans make our state a culturally vibrant place to live, work and play."</p>
				<p>Research shows that investments in arts and culture -- in museums, performances and historic buildings, for example -- help communities boost tourism, attract businesses, retain workers and improve the overall quality of life for residents. Accordingly, the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs helps Iowans invest in the people, places and points of pride that define our state.</p>
				<p>For the new fiscal year that started July 1, the department awarded a total of $2,091,162 in 210 grants through two of its divisions -- the Iowa Arts Council and the State Historical Society of Iowa. The Iowa Arts Council awarded a total of $1,403,265. Grants ranging from $10,000 to $20,000 were awarded to 43 Cultural Leadership Partners -- anchor organizations across the state that significantly contribute to their surrounding regions.</p>
				<p>Colts programs serve young people who desire high levels of challenge, achievement and success and they carry an expectation that members are committed to hard work and dedication. The organization has been in continuous existence since their founding in 1963. The Colts are proud to represent Iowans across the country each summer as "Iowa's Ambassadors of Music."</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Annual Car Wash Fundraiser</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
                <p><i>June 6, 2018</i></p>
                <p>The 240 members of the Colts and Colt Cadets will be practicing more than music on Saturday, June 9, as they instead become experts at washing cars! Twenty simultaneous locations will be staffed with members of both corps from 9:00 a.m to 4:00 p.m. for the annual Colts Car Wash fundraiser. Since the inception of this program in 1985, over $350,000 has been raised for summer travel expenses of the Colts and Colt Cadets.</p>
    <p>Last year, the groups washed nearly 1,000 cars and earned over $46,000 in donations and paid pledges. Proceeds from the car wash will be used for summer tour costs. Increased prices for diesel and food will be a real challenge this summer, and the car wash helps get the two groups down the road.</p>
    <p>The car wash is free, with donations accepted. There is no minimum donation expected. The weather looks to be a great day for a car wash - sunny and a high of 80 - so be sure to stop at one of the many locations around Dubuque!</p>
    <p>The Colts would like to extend a big <b>THANK YOU</b> to our host sites! The car wash would not be successful without the warm welcome we receive from these businesses.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">June Alumni Feature: Interview With Evan Saddler</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
                <img src="/img/news/EvanSaddler2.jpg" height="" width="500" alt="Evan Saddler" class="alignleft imageborder">
                <p><i>June 1, 2018</i></p>
                <p>All of us who have been through the rigors of drum corps have used the experiences we gained during our time as members to become more productive citizens. Some of us have become teachers or doctors. Some of us have become laborers or accountants or nurses. And, a few have continued on to be professional musicians. One particular alumnus is Evan Saddler. Evan grew up in Dubuque, and attended Sageville Elementary, Jefferson Middle School, and Stephen Hempstead High School.</p>
                <p>At the age of eight, he began playing the saxophone, and soon after started dabbling in piano. Around the same time, he attended a Music On The March show at Dubuque Senior High School and got the "drum corps bug." He noticed that drum corps did not march saxophones and decided to try out for the Colt Cadets on percussion at age 13. In 2007, Evan started on marimba and vibraphone. In 2008, he played top bass drum, and during 2009, his final year with the Colt Cadets, he was on the snare line.</p>
                <p>In 2010, Evan made the cut and secured a spot in the Colts front ensemble playing rack and auxiliary percussion. 2010 was Evan's only year marching World Class drum corps, but he credits the instructors from all four years with the Colts Youth Organization as fundamental in discovering his passion for music and pursing it as a career.</p>
                <p>After his summer in the Colts, Evan spent his last two years of high school at the Interlochen Arts Academy in northern Michigan. After graduating in 2012, Evan was not certain if a music career was what his heart was driving him towards, and he enrolled at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. There, he began a liberal arts degree with an interest in economics and communication, while still pursuing his musical interests.</p>
                <p>After his freshman year, his heart and mind nudged him towards fully pursuing a music performance degree. He transferred to the University of Michigan, after being strongly influenced by Joseph Gramley, the percussionist in the Grammy-Award winning group Silk Road Ensemble, led by cellist Yo-Yo Ma.</p>
                <p>After spending three formative years in Ann Arbor, Evan's skill and drive led him to one of the coveted spots at The Juilliard School in New York City. In May 2018, he graduated from Juilliard with a Master's of Music in percussion. <b>It should be noted in the undergraduate and graduate program combined there are only 10 students.</b></p>
                <p>When preparing for this article, Evan was caught by surprise that we wanted to speak to him. When he began to reflect about his time in the Colts, one could sense his humbleness. You could sense the emotions he holds from his marching days had a strong impact on him as a person and as a musician.</p>
                <p>"All of the values and skills I learned in corps gave me the confidence to work and communicate with lots of different people. The Colts mission, 'We use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life,' was taught through the lessons of hard work, like the 12-hour rehearsal days in the July Texas heat, playing a show, then sleeping on buses and arriving in the wee hours of the morning in a new town so that we could do it all again the next day. We were always striving to be better, while having some fun along the way."</p>
                <p>Evan elaborated on how his days in corps have helped him today. "Being one of the younger guys in the corps, I learned a tremendous amount from the older members who were much more musically advanced than I was. Being around people who were a lot better than me provided a great opportunity for me to grow from their experience."</p>
                <p>Evan noted, from leaving home to going to school at Interlochen to making ends meet in New York City, that drum corps has helped him deal with hardships. "Drum corps taught me how to tackle almost any situation with a positive attitude. This has helped a lot in living in New York, where it seems that everything that can go wrong does."</p>
                <p>Evan has stated that the strongest influencers from his time with the Colts and Colt Cadets were Brian Zeglis, JJ Thomas, Ronnie LaGrone, Max Mullinix, Vicki MacFarlane, and Greg Orwoll.</p>
                <p>In particular, Evan recalls during his first year in the Colt Cadets, he thought he would only march one year. However, after the Dubuque home show, Greg Orwoll spoke with the Cadets and Evan said he "felt like I was part of something much bigger than myself, the sense of family that everyone talks about hit me." This pushed him to march three more years with the organization.</p>
                <p>While at Juilliard, Evan has not only pursued his Master's, but has been active as a music educator. He served as an instructor for middle school students in a program called the Music Advancement Program, as a mentor for high school students within the Juilliard Pre-College program, and as a teaching assistant in Juilliard's freshman Entrepreneurship course.</p>
                <p>Evan is also the co-artistic director and percussionist for <a href="https://con-duit.org" target="_blank">Conduit</a>, an ensemble he brought to fruition with another student and friend from Julliard. Drawing from his drum corps days, Evan is tying together elements from music, choreography, and staging to fulfill Conduit's mission of creating performance experiences for Millennial audiences.</p>
                <p>You can see Evan in Iowa this summer at <a href="https://nisom.com/index.php/outreach/chamberfest-dubuque" target="_blank">ChamberFest Dubuque</a> during the first week of June. ChamberFest was started by another Dubuquer, Juilliard graduate, and Pulitzer Prize finalist, composer Michael Gilbertson. You can also see him in August in Madison, where he will be performing at the <a href="https://madisonnewmusic.org" target="_blank">Madison New Music Festival</a> with Conduit. You can learn more about Evan Saddler at <a href="https://www.evandsaddler.com" target="_blank">evandsaddler.com</a></p>
                <p>Evan also hopes to be in attendance for the alumni festivities on July 13, 2018, at Music On The March. "Hope to see you all there!"</p>

		</div>
	</div>
                <p><i>May 24, 2018</i></p>
                <p>Old becoming new again is the idea behind the Colt Cadets 2018 program, <b>Moderne</b>. The approach parallels the aesthetic of Art Deco — existing art and architecture reimagined in streamlined and futuristic fashion, or Style Moderne. In Art Deco, futuristic and abstract art forms exist juxtaposed or superimposed on traditional forms.</p>                
                <p>The program starts with a futuristic, jazz-flavored interpretation of “Un Bel Di,” the iconic theme from Puccini’s <i>Madame Butterfly</i>. Starting with <i>Madame Butterly</i>, the corps blends shapes, music, and visual aesthetics through the lens of Art Deco style. After the opener, things take an unexpected twist. The corps begins its second production with the very somber opening of the second movement from Beethoven’s <i>Symphony No. 7</i>, which suddenly flips to a rhumba — an imagining of Beethoven on a Miami vacation.</p>
                <p>By its nature, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is old meets new, evoking the era of the roaring ‘20s, flappers, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Colt Cadets recall that time while performing new music written to fit the occasion, “Young and Beautiful” by Lana Del Rey. Next is a variation of the Art Deco aesthetic — new becoming old. What if Bach wrote for Lady Gaga? The result might be Colt Cadets “Bad Romance,” which is a Bach fugue-influenced treatment of one of Lady Gaga's breakout hits.</p>
                <p>If Mussorgsky wrote jazz, he might have treated his <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i> as the Colt Cadets will in “Hut of Baba Yaga” and “Great Gate of Kiev.” Combining the traditional Russian music with the expressiveness of the American jazz scene brings the program full circle as the Colt Cadets explore all the facets of Style Moderne.</p>

                <p>Success is an intangible pursuit — often a matter of personal definition, and relative to where we are in life. Do we find success in our accomplishments? Or is success defined by the riches we attain, or the things that surround us and make us feel complete? Success can be elusive as the destination seems to change as we move through time. So how do we know when we get there? How can one arrive to a place they know today, but is no longer in view when they search again later? The 2018 Colts present the quest of the <b>True Believer</b>.</p>

                <p><b>CAR PARKING OVER SUMMER</b><br>
                If you are driving your car, you will park it for the weekend at Roosevelt, and then take it to the corps hall prior to us leaving the school Monday morning for the parade. Your car will be kept throughout the summer at our vehicle lot at the corps hall. The lot is not secured. We prefer that you do not leave a car in Dubuque for the summer. If you have no other alternative, contact Jason at <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a> in advance. Only leave your car in Dubuque if absolutely essential. <i>Although we do our best to keep everything safe, the Colts accept no responsibility for vehicles left in Dubuque</i>.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br>
                These parts have been added to your bill and are on your statement. The parts will be handed out at Move Ins. Each brass and battery member receives a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass, cymbals, and DM also purchase gloves). Prices for brass, cymbals, and DM will be $100, battery $80 (no gloves), front ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $150 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag, and other necessary personal items.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>CAR WASH: JUNE 9, 2018</b><br>
                This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>
                <p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 9.</p>
                <p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $50,000 in our one-day event! It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas, and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones. The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p>
                <p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge will end up being around $7.50. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received. We collect these payments through the office by mail or online. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5.00. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p>
                <p>New for 2018: For donations and pledges collected and turned in prior at move ins, members who collect $225 or more will receive a $25 gift card to the souvie stand. Members who collect and turn in $300 or more will get a $50 gift card to the souvie stand.</p>

                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Students will stay overnight in the gym on the floor, like they do all summer. Bring changes of clothes (we recommend layered athletic clothing), shower supplies, towel, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans), tennis shoes (no high tops), and a water bottle. Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. Depending on the weather, we plan to spend some time outside! Be prepared for anything! This means t-shirt, shorts, wind or sweat pants, sweatshirt, and light jacket. Tennis shoes are a must! Bring a hat for the sun.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Brass:</b> Bring your own mouthpiece, music stand, and binder for music, if you are able. We will have extra mouthpieces and stands at the camp if you don't have your own. We will provide all instruments for the weekend. You may bring your own marching instrument if you would like.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Percussion:</b> Bring your own sticks or mallets and practice pads, if you are able. We will provide all instruments for the weekend.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Color Guard:</b> We will provide all flags, rifle, and sabres, but you can bring your own if you would like. Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans).</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>HINTS FOR MAY REHEARSAL</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Bring clothes for any weather (snow, rain or heat wave). You may be outside for much of the weekend, working on drill and music. Don’t forget cold weather gear. You just never know. Right now there is no rain scheduled, but Iowa weather can change at the last minute.</li>
		<li>Two pairs of comfortable tennis shoes (no high tops). One pair is for wet and mud that will be taken off before entering the school if it rains or is wet outdoors.</li>
		<li>Athletic braces for any previous injuries or weaknesses. You will be on your feet a lot this weekend, so protect yourself against injury.</li>
		<li>Other helpful items: extra socks, sunscreen, lip protection (DCT) with sunscreen, hat or bandanna, sunglasses, a smile, backpack (field bag) and water bottle or jug. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
    <br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting will be held Friday evening at 8:00 p.m. in a location to be announced. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend<br>
                <br>
                Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colt Cadets successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colt Cadets experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here. Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand. The Colt Cadets staff will also be available throughout the weekend to answer any questions you may have about the drum corps experience, what we do, and how we do it.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school or stay in a hotel. For all events, we recommend the <a href="https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="_blank">Hampton Inn</a> for your stay in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a>, select the front desk, and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate. Students are expected to stay with the group overnight in the arena. As always, email or call us with any questions you may have.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="/signupform" target="_blank">email distribution list</a> to receive Colts information via email.<br>
                <br>
                <p><b>WEEKEND SCHEDULE</b><br>
                A snack before bed will be provided on Friday night after rehearsal. Four meals will be provided on Saturday, and a breakfast and sack lunch will be provided on Sunday. We will eat off of the Colt Cadets food truck (affectionately called the "Chuck Wagon") just like we do on tour!<br>
                <br>

If you are unable to attend the whole weekend, you are definitely still able to participate! Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all.

                Throughout the weekend, many items in the <a href="https://store.colts.org" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a> will be available for sale!

		</div>
	</div>
                <p><i>May 1, 2018</i></p>
                <p>For this month's alumni newsletter, we asked Kent Lineberry to share his experience with the corps song, "Morning." Kent was a member of the Colts from 1996 to 1999 as a tenor player, and was on staff from 2000 to 2005, 2007, and 2017 to 2018. The corps song holds a special place in many alumni's memories with the corps, and Kent was excited to share his memories of the piece and the story of how it became known as the corps song.</p>

				<p><b><i>Background of the corps and “Morning”</i></b></p>
                <p>No matter which era you marched in, you know that the corps, known as the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps, founded in 1963 as the Junior Dukes, is one of the most special and valuable youth organizations in the United States. The organization’s mission statement is, “We use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life.” This mission is achieved through a rigorous audition process where hundreds of potential members try out for a few spots and culminates in a two month long national tour.</p>
                <p>The experience of marching in the corps is something that sticks with all members. Some members march only one season. Some move on to march in other corps. Some march their entire career with the corps until they “age out,” when they become too old to compete in a Drum Corps International corps. But all members are changed in fundamental ways, grow as human beings in ways that are difficult to describe, and cherish this experience forever. It is something a person cannot be told; one can only experience the love and honor that comes with sacrificing their comfort, and sometimes literally blood, sweat, and tears, for the noble pursuit of an art form.</p>
                <p>The corps did not select a corps song for many decades. It was presumably brought up many times, with many suggestions, but all I can share with you is my perspective. I was a member, on staff, or connected to the corps from basically 1996 to the present. I also gained some insight from my wife, Debbie, who marched 1991 - 1997 and also taught on staff for years.</p>
                <p>In 1998, the corps played “Morning” as a part of their program, “An A Capella Celebration.” The lyrics of this piece became very important to the corps, as this was the year they were involved in a three bus accident in Montreal, Quebec. Multiple members were rushed to the hospital with major contusions, concussions, and facial injuries from the impact. The 1998 corps quickly realized that their time together on this good Earth and as a drum corps for the summer was precious, not guaranteed, and fragile. The lyrics of this piece helped power that edition of the Colts into finals in 1998 after being a semifinalist in 1997.</p>
                <p>In 1999, the Corps leadership wanted to institute “Morning” as the corps song. The discussion was tabled after purposeful discussions with some of the most influential staff members of that era, as this is not the sort of thing one rushes into. However, the corps began to truly and palpably feel the absence of that unifying element of their experience. They noted that other corps had a unifying corps song, and felt this was something the Colts deserved, and would soon demand. The seed was sown.</p>
                <p>"Morning" continued to be important to the members, even without being a corps song, and was often played to wake the corps on finals day, or during morning stretch to start the day. The lyrics were constantly referred to in context of the corps: sacrifice, the special bonds that are formed, and what makes the Colts special.</p>
                <p>In 2005, the corps was finally allowed to choose a corps song. They were made cognizant of the fact that what they would choose would reflect on generations of Colts, and that they needed to choose with great care. However, traditions must begin somewhere, and it was decided by Corps Director Greg Orwoll that it would begin here. The members and staff were allowed to submit suggestions for review. The choices included “Old Man River,” “Summertime,” “Morning,” and several others. All of the works considered were important to the corps in one way or another, at one time or another. Staff members “adopted” a corps song candidate, and presented the song to the corps, with explanation for why it was a good choice. I was honored to represent “Morning” by Vox One to the corps.</p>
                <p>Due in no part to my bumbling presentation, the membership overwhelmingly chose "Morning" as their corps song. It continues to this day to be special to the members and alumni that are aware of the meaning.</p>
                <p>An explanation below will hopefully help alumni before 1998 understand why this work was chosen. It was chosen to honor the special experience that is being a member of the Colts. There is something that connects alumni of the corps that transcends uniforms, music selections, asymmetrical drill, and the like. It’s the shared bond of coming to Dubuque to test one’s mettle and audition for a corps, hoping for the chance to work incredibly hard all summer while your classmates from school were relaxing at home. It represents the closeness that members get by shared misery and joy, common living conditions, and uncommon brother and sisterhood. It’s pushing a bus. It’s doing four parades on the 4th of July and then doing a show, with a loud carnival going on 100 feet from the end zone. It’s helping a bloodied corps mate off a totaled bus on a Canadian superhighway. It’s connecting during the off season after the loss of a beloved member to a tragic accident. It’s the fact that when members get back together decades later, it’s as if they just walked off the field and are standing in line at the cook truck again. It’s those things that make this special, and it’s those things this corps song celebrates.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b><i>An explanation of why “Morning” was chosen.</i></b></p>
                <p>Again, this is my interpretation of this, and it holds slightly different meaning for each member. My intention for this is to reach out to those that came before me, and let them know why this song means so much to the corps today, and how it actually reflects the intangibles that make this corps great. It refers to our past and the connections we all share.</p>
                
                <p><i>Aurora breaks with passion and glory<br>
                    To harken the song of sunrise,<br>
                    The opening eyes of everyday morning<br>
                    And the rose wine blush of the sun.<br>
                    As I hold you near in silence,<br>
                    I drift between my dreams and the dawn.</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Analysis: waking in the morning is a sacred part of drum corps. Most of the time, the drum major wakes the corps gently, to help us begin our day. The morning is different for every member, but we all share the experience of sore muscles and sun burnt skin.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                 <p><i>A whirlwind of emotion<br>
                    takes me tumbling into dreams of you<br>
                    Lost inside darkness all around me.<br>
                    Then soft, like the sun,<br>
                    which sparkles with beauty,<br>
                    You take all the shadows away.<br>
                    As I hold you near in silence<br>
                    You are the joy of morning to me.</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Analysis: these lyrics remind me of the way Colts support each other, and the difficult way we are ripped apart one evening in August. Competing for what could be the last time, whether it’s Thursday night or Saturday night, is the very definition of “a whirlwind of emotions.” I remember very clearly the feeling of darkness all around me when I was finally alone on an airplane, in my first shower at home, wherever that moment was, I felt incredible sadness that was tough to deal with. But, as we all know, all it takes is a phone call or some other communication with the people we marched with, and it is like we never left each others’ sides. It truly took all the shadows away during that tough time right after tour ended.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                 <p><i>In the stillness...<br>
                    In the first light of dawn I see.<br>
                    No more shadows, only light cradles me.<br>
                    I am strong again.</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Analysis: I feel like these lines remind me literally of the mornings waking up on tour. You’ve achieved this amazing dream of being a member of a drum corps, you’ve met these amazing friends, and sometimes I woke up wondering if it was all a dream. But there was Jeff “Ed” Caswell, or Jason “Ankle” Long, or even my own brother Matt there on the gym floor, and I knew it was all OK. The line “I am strong again” is particularly poignant in that way.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                <p><i>A soul that once was hungry for beauty <br>
                    Now rejoices with you in the morning.<br>
                    It's love so strong that makes me wonder<br>
                    Would my heart still beat on its own?</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Analysis: if you need much explanation on this, you never felt drum corps like I did. I wondered, literally, if I could make it without my corps mates when the season ended. It turns out I could, but that’s how much these relationships meant to us. And it resonates with the members today in just the same way... the year is irrelevant.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                <p><i>As I hold you near in silence<br>
                    How fragile is the time that we share<br> 
                    Together</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Analysis: these lines, unfortunately, remind the corps of some difficult things. First, their time together is always coming closer to an end. Second, no matter how hard we may try, we will never get the same members and staff in the same place ever again, period. Because third, we have lost members during their marching years, shortly after aging out, or later in life. The time we shared as members of the Colts came to an end. It’s an incredibly important experience and incredibly important relationships that are incredibly finite.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                <p><i>Hold on...hold on to your dreams.<br>
					Hold on...hold on to what morning brings.</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Analysis: these lines encourage us to make the most of our time as a member. To get your toes up a little more. To straighten the leg a little more. To tune that note or do that visual just right each time. To really mean it when the drum major called the corps to attention. We all dreamed of being that person carrying that drum, that horn, that flag, and during our time we must make the most of it, and be completely spent at the end of each block.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                <p><i>In the stillness...<br>
                    In the first light of dawn I see.<br>
                    No more shadows,<br>
                    Where only light carries me on.<br>
                    I am strong again, but I'll need you when<br>
                    Morning's gone again...<br>
                    Hold on...to morning.</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Analysis: I think this simply ties a bow on all that is above. We need each other. We miss each other when we are not together. And even when we are older, some mornings, when we wake up, we wonder why our buddy isn’t there next to us. And we get up anyway, and move on to take care of our day with the same class and effort that we put into our time in the corps.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                 
                 <p>I realize after writing this how hollow my words are compared to the power this song truly holds for the members of the corps. However, I cannot help but point out that each point along the way, each reason for meaning behind these words, should be universal for us all. It has nothing to do with a certain style of uniform, the pieces we played, G bugles or Bb horns, free floating snare drums or sling harnesses. It has to do with the relationships and the specialness that is our corps. I hope that this honest attempt to explicate the lyrics will make “Morning” special to you as well. I hope you someday take the chance to attend the home show in Dubuque and hear the corps play “Morning.”</p>

                <p><i>April 25, 2018</i></p>
                
                <p>Last week, Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane was recognized by the <a href="https://www.dubuquewln.org" target="_blank">Women's Leadership Network of Dubuque</a> for service and support of nonprofit work. Vicki was one of nearly 50 women in the Dubuque area nominated for several awards through the organization, and was one of two to receive recognition for nonprofit work.</p>
                <p>"I am very thankful for the recognition from the Women's Leadership Network and for the support from those around me," said Vicki. "It's always wonderful to have the Colts story shared with others. Tonight was a great opportunity to tell the story of the Colts, and the drum corps activity, with the local community."
                <p>Vicki was nominated by a group of board members and volunteers who submitted a letter of support to the Women's Leadership Network. Her nominators write, "Vicki is a remarkable leader. She is a passionate educator. She is a compassionate mentor. She is an attentive listener. She is a motivator. She is the engineer that has masterfully taken all the moving parts of this well-respected youth organization on the road to represent the people of Dubuque and Iowa. Vicki’s job description is a difficult task to define, but it is Vicki’s steadfast leadership that allows it all to happen."</p>
                <p>Vicki was a member of the Colts in 1994 and 1995 as a baritone player. After a few years teaching band in eastern Iowa, Vicki began volunteering with the Colts. This led to a teaching position with Colt Cadets in 2001, and then being asked to be the Colt Cadets director for the 2002 season. The corps in 2001 had 18 members, but by 2012 had over 75 members and was a perennial Open Class finalist. While director of Colt Cadets, Vicki also served as chair of Drum Corps International's Open Class Advisory Committee for several years. For the 2013 season, Vicki became the director of the Colts, and is currently entering her sixth season as director. In addition, she serves as director of youth programs for the Colts Youth Organization and is a member of the <a href="https://www.dci.org/news/dci-launches-in-step-women-in-dci-initiative" target="_blank">IN STEP: Women In DCI</a> initiative.</p>
                <p>The Women’s Leadership Network (WLN) is comprised of women who have a special focus — they are leaders, entrepreneurs, and professionals with a sincere commitment to their careers, their families, the community, and their own personal growth. Members meet monthly to network with other members, participate in workshops, and learn from guest speakers. The WLN has been recognizing women in the Dubuque area for outstanding leadership, service, and growth since 2012.</p>

                <p>The Colts Youth Organization is committed to an environment in which relationships are characterized by dignity, honesty, courtesy, respect, and equitable treatment. This includes a commitment to create and maintain a positive organizational culture and climate which:<br>
                <uL>
                	<li>is welcoming of difference and diversity and is based on inclusivity</li>
                    <li>encourages members, staff, and volunteers to disclose and discuss incidents of bullying or harassment in a non-threatening environment</li>
                    <li>promotes respectful relationships across the entire organization</li>
                    <li>is free from any form or threat of harassment</li>
                </uL>
                </p>
                
                <p>Over the past 18 months, the Colts Board of Directors and administrative staff have spent significant time reviewing and updating all of our policies, procedures, and operations. We are a nonprofit youth organization, and the safety, well-being, and education of the students we serve is the driving force behind everything we do.</p>
                
                <p>In April of 2017, our Board of Directors completed revisions of the bylaws for the organization (found <a href="/documents/policy_BOD_bylaws_Apr2017.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). These bylaws provide the organizational foundation on which the business is built. In May of 2017, the Board of Directors adopted a policy that requires annual criminal background checks for all staff and volunteers (found <a href="/documents/policy_background_checks.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). This policy was enacted in accordance with the Drum Corps International Strategic Plan, adopted in 2017 (found <a href="https://issuu.com/drumcorpsinternational/docs/dci_2017_strategic_plan_final_print" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
                
                <p>In March 2018, our Board of Directors completed revisions of the Personnel Policies for Seasonal Staff, which applies to both paid staff members and volunteers. Specific attention was paid to our <a href="/documents/PersonalConduct_April2018.pdf" target="_blank">Personal Conduct Policy</a>, which includes behavior between members, between members and staff or volunteers, and between staff and volunteers. Definitions, examples, and reporting mechanisms for abuse, bullying, hazing, hostility, or sexual harassment were added to provide a comprehensive list and examples of behaviors the Colts Youth Organization does not condone or support. Violation of any of these policies by anyone associated with the organization may be grounds for dismissal or termination of employment. The updated document can be found <a href="/documents/SeasonalStaffPolicies_March2018.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                
                <p>We have also updated policies and all of our reporting processes to be consistent. Our formal "chain of command," from the bottom all the way to the top, is member to section leader, to drum major, to caption head, to program director or tour director, to corps director, to executive director, to board president. Anyone at the Colts is able to go to whomever they are most comfortable, and anyone is welcome to jump straight to the top of our list.</p>
                
                <p>We also firmly believe in, and are committed to, creating and maintaining an open and transparent environment where any concerns can be brought to any person of authority. This culture serves us well, and we are committed to continuing it into the future  — commonly referred to as providing a "scholastic environment" within the organization. To that end, we also understand it is essential we provide an avenue for confidential and anonymous submission of concerns, complaints, and issues. We have added a webpage (found <a href="/whistleblower.php" target="_blank">here</a>) dedicated to our whistleblower process that allows anyone to submit concerns, complaints, or issues anonymously.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, we have updated our website in several key areas to make these documents easily accessible to anyone. At the bottom of each webpage are links to the Colts Member Handbook, Personnel Policies for Seasonal Staff, our whistleblower process, and our Contact page. Under Quicklinks, our Documents page was divided into one page for Member Documents and one page for Policies and Procedures</p>
                
                <p>The Colts Member Handbook (found <a href="/documents/MemberHandbook_2018.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) for 2018 includes language from the updated  <a href="/documents/PersonalConduct_March2018.pdf" target="_blank">Personal Conduct Policy</a>. The member handbook is updated annually and outlines our expectations of behavior for members. We are committed to creating an environment where member-to-member abuse, bullying, hazing, hostility, or sexual harassment is non-existent.</p> 
                
                <p>We are also committed to developing a culture of leadership and member accountability. In September 2015, Howard Weinstein joined the organization, bringing with him a formal leadership program that allowed us to expedite many cultural changes within the corps and helped strengthen our culture of openness, transparency, and accountability. Howard's formal leadership course includes monthly conference calls for leadership training, as well as meetings during camp weekends, and is open to any member of the drum corps. We interview and use an application process to select section leaders and other titled leadership positions within the drum corps. Regular communication between staff and the leadership team continues throughout the summer.</p>
                
                <p>New for 2018, we are offering a scholarship for any leadership team member who completes a bullying, hazing, and inappropriate behaviors course offered online through the <a href="https://nfhslearn.com" target="_blank">National Federation of State High School Associations</a>. The NFHS is a nonprofit that has "led the development of education-based interscholastic sports and activities that help students succeed in their lives." Their programs and trainings reach 18,500 high schools nationally and over 11 million students. The course can be found online <a href="https://nfhslearn.com/courses/28000/bullying-hazing-and-inappropriate-behaviors" target="_blank">here</a>. Through this course, students develop an added awareness of how to respond, handle, and react to situations that may arise on tour or in their personal lives.</p>               
                
                <p>All of these updates are designed to make the Colts Youth Organization stronger and allow us to continue providing life-changing experiences for all of our members, staff, volunteers, alumni, donors, fans, and anyone connected to the organization. Drum corps should be an environment free from any form of sexual harassment, bullying, abuse, hazing, or hostility, and the Colts are are committed to creating that environment. Should you have any comments, concerns, or questions, you may direct them to our Board President Peter Hansen (<a href="mailto:coltsboard63@gmail.com">coltsboard63@gmail.com</a>), Board Member Cathi Roberts (<a href="mailto:cathiroberts.omaha@gmail.com">cathiroberts.omaha@gmail.com</a>), or Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane (<a href="jeff@colts.org">jeff@colts.org</a>). We look forward to having another incredible season in 2018, and believe it will be another amazing year for the drum corps activity.</p>

                <p><i>April 1, 2018</i></p>
                <p>1993 was a special year for the Colts, and one that still stands proudly in the memory of anyone assicated with the corps throughout the years. This month, we had several alumni and staff share their memories of that incredible season. Below are some of the many stories these four individuals, and many others who were a part of that season, shared with us.</p>
                <p><b><i>From Steve "Slim" Delaney, Colts Member 1974 - 1982; Staff 1983 - 1988, 1990 - 2001; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 1995</i></b></p>
                <p>About this time 25 years ago, the Colts design team and instructional staff were busy putting together the “Four Seasons” show. It was without a doubt an upgrade from the “Four Seasons” show of the prior year, and staff thought it was going to be pretty good. Hopefully, good enough to get the corps into the Friday night show – Semifinals – later in the season at the Drum Corps International World Championships in Jackson, Mississippi. That was the goal before the competitive season began – to advance beyond the Thursday Quarterfinals and into Semifinals. As it turned out, there was a better ending for all of us who were a part of the 1993 Red Team.</p>
                <p>Everyone is familiar with the ending to the story - a 12th place finish at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Finals. Performing on Saturday instead of sitting in the cheap seats. The improvement from 20th in 1992 to 12th in 1993 is still one of the largest year-to-year improvements of any corps in the activity.</p>
                <p>I didn't play a large role that year, coming in on weekends and saving summer vacation from my day job to tour with the corps whenever possible. My job was to make sure the percussion line moved their feet together. They did, and many viewers, including some judges, remarked that our drum line was one of the best marching drum lines in the country.</p>
                <p>One night, about midway through the season, we drove from one place in the Midwest to some other place in the Midwest (they all end up looking the same). Those staffers who finished the drive typically found a local diner for a meal before sunrise, something we called the “breakfast club.” That morning, I was sitting with Corps Director Greg Orwoll and Program Director Jeff Bridges, and between coffee and pancakes, we spent a lot of time talking about what a special team we had. The staff was incredibly passionate about the season, and the members repeatedly exceeded the goals we set out for them. I mentioned that, as the season had progressed and we kept climbing, my buddies that I marched with back in the day were constantly calling me (on landlines - there were no cell phones back then). "What's going on?" was the typical question. "They're really good" was the typical response.</p>
                <p>Greg and Jeff asked if I'd give a talk to the corps before the show the next night to offer up some perspective on where the corps came from, how special this team was, and the attention it was garnering from a lot of people. I don't recall all of what I said, but I do recall reminding the students that the foundation for the 1993 team was set by the previous years’ corps, we were just witnessing all that work come to fruition now. I also noted that, while there had been many Colts teams before them, and there would be many Colts teams after them, this was their team and their year. And, come the third week in August, it would all be in the history books, and they'd have to ask themselves if they did all they could to make the most of the experience.</p>
                <p>Turns out, they did.</p>

				<p><b><i>From Beth Wilson, Staff 1984 - 2010; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 2003</i></b></p>
                <p>What I remember most about 1993 was the achievement of something that many people (perhaps even ourselves?) thought was impossible.</p>
                <p>The most often heard comment about the 1993 Colts (from others) was “they came out of nowhere.” Well, everyone knows that that simply isn’t true, and it is <b>never</b> true about a group that seems suddenly successful. There were years of hard work and struggle to become the corps that “came out of nowhere.” The plan in 1990, according to Jeff Bridges, was to make Semifinals in 1993 and Finals in 1994. I guess we overachieved and skipped a year.</p>
                <p>Saturday morning there was a panic among the staff - not about the show or the kids, but rather about what to wear. None of us - nobody - had brought something suitable for Finals. So, we made a mad dash to the mall. It was Steve Huggins, Ron Coleman, Becky Thurston (Uffie), maybe Leah Ratliff, and myself. I have never bought a black dress and heels so quickly. Just for the record - I still have that black dress, and the receipt from the purchase. Yes, I'm a nerd. That summer still has the best memories with some of the best people I can imagine.</p>
                <p>To the kids that stuck around - especially after 1991 - I was so happy for them, that their belief in the corps paid off.</p>
                <br>

				<p><b><i>From Christian Baughman, Colts Member 1991 - 1996; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 2017</i></b></p>
                <p>What can be said about a “Cinderella Story?” We were the little corps the could. There are so many memories from that summer, it’s hard to narrow it down to just a few to share. Here are a few of my favorites, though. A small selection of the many stories from that summer, but I think these are things some may not know or remember about that summer.</p>
                <p>One of the most unique parts of the preseason was when the drummer from <i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i>, Ed Shaughnessy, came to visit. I think it was at our March camp, and we played “Summertime” with him. I’m still not totally sure how he ended up in Dubuque that weekend, but it’s still one of my favorite camp memories. That camp was also the last time I played mellophone in the Colts brassline - the next camp I was on the podium conducting. I vividly remember my first camp as drum major, and one moment in particular. We were in music ensemble, outside one of the Dubuque middle schools. It was probably drizzling (doesn’t it always rain on April camp weekend?) and I was watching Miki Sato, a first year front ensemble member from Japan. While conducting, I remember thinking, “this experience is probably as foreign to me as it is to her.” In fact, I thought it may have been easier to be Miki at that moment. By the end of that summer, I had finally learned how to be competent on the podium, and she had not only learned English, but had taught us all some great Japanese curse words. There is nothing like diving in the deep end to learn to swim.</p>
                <p>The summer was a crazy ride, as it always is every season. The corps made great leaps forward competitively, and a little extra push for us came from an unlikely source. Sometimes, it takes an outside voice to tell you how good you really are. One night in July, DCI judge Rich Nicola requested to talk to the corps. After the show, we were all gathered around the cook truck to hear straight from a DCI judge, which was a very rare opportunity. He spoke at length about how special our show was, how special our moment was, and how special the corps was. It was truly a pivotal moment in the summer, after which many of the members started to believe that making a historic run into the top 12 was really a possibility. Rich’s challenge line was, “now is your time to seize the Golden Chalice.” We all knew exactly what that meant.</p>
                <p>Aside from motivational speeches from a wide variety of sources, competition with other corps was also a major factor that summer. The official line from the corps leadership was always “just be your best, be better today than you were yesterday, and leave the schools cleaner than you found them.” However, in the back of one of the busses, Scott Weber had a list of all the corps who had finished above the Colts in 1992. As the season progressed, more and more corps were crossed out. Scott was always good at saying what everyone else needed to hear, but might have been afraid to say out loud. It was a super exciting (and motivating) part of the summer to watch those corps who had beaten us for so long be crossed off that list.</p>
                <p>By the last week of the season, the corps was truly committed to being the best they could possibly be. The staff and the members were constantly pushing each other to be better, and each day you could really see how much the corps improved. You would think the staff would want to continue this and try to squeeze every element of rehearsal out of the corps on the brink of making finals, but Wednesday night Greg Orwoll took the whole corps to see a movie. The choice was “Rookie Of The Year” and it was another Cinderella Story about a 12 year old with a gifted arm who ends up pitching for the Chicago Cubs and taking them deep into playoffs. It was a cheesy movie, but it certainly ended up inspiring real life later that week.</p>
                <p>Waking up on Saturday morning and knowing we were going to be able to perform one last time was truly an indescribable feeling. One of the coolest moments of that morning was waking up to a huge banner posted above the cook truck. The hand painted banner read “Bluecoats Welcome The Colts To The Top 12” and had both corps logos on it. We were the first new corps to break into the top 12 in a few years, and it meant a lot to us to have a perennial finalist send that gesture. I’ve always respected and cheered for the Bluecoats since then.</p>
                <br>
                <img src="/img/news/1993_staff.jpg" height="" width="400" alt="1993 Staff" class="alignright imageborder">
                <p><b><i>From Chuck Naffier, Member 1980 - 1984; Staff 1985 - 1987, 1990 - 1999, and 2014 - 2015; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 2003</i></b></p>
                <p>It all began innocently enough, with enthusiasm and a sense of knowing this time was going to be different. A large returning membership from 1992 created a strong base on which to build the corps. The staff truly was on another level - they were gelling not only as creative and teaching partners, but as life-long friends who truly enjoyed the ride and the activity.</p>
                <p>A couple of highlights that still stand out for me…</p>
                <p>The winter:<br>
We we knew we wanted to create a show based on a concept about changing seasons and were struggling to come up with an opener. After several months of looking, our percussion arranger, Jerry Carpenter, suggested that I “just write an original composition.” This shocked me, because I’d never written anything in my life, and certainly had no background with composition. However, it set the wheels in motion. Dean Musson, one of the brass instructors, threw out the idea of building off the end of the 1992 show with a musical quote from “Carol Of The Bells.” The idea took off, and eventually morphed into a series of melodies and impacts that ultimately created “Winter,” our opener for the show.</p>
				<p>With three of the four seasons down, we were now having trouble finding a suitable piece for summer. We as a staff kept avoiding the obvious - we were hesitant to try to recreate what the previous generation of Colts had done. Under Corps Director Jim Mason, the Colts had played Gershwin's’ “Summertime” from <i>Porgy And Bess</i> for three years in a row (1980 - 1982). But, no matter what we tried, we kept coming back to “Summertime.” Finally, we shook off our hesitations and went full steam ahead with “Summertime.” It really felt like putting the final piece of the puzzle together - the show really clicked now, and we knew we were on to something special.</p>
                <img src="/img/news/1993_weber.jpg" height="" width="400" alt="1993 Performance" class="alignleft imageborder">
                <p>Now, all we needed were a couple of hot-shot soprano soloists. Enter the Weber brothers. Scott and Eric, Iowa natives and multi-year vets, took on the challenging of wowing crowds across the country every night that year. If you could hear the initial recordings of their auditions from February of that year, you would definitely be wondering what we were thinking. But, those boys went home and dedicated themselves to making it happen.  I’ve never been more proud of two performers in my life.</p>
                <p>That winter, Ed Shaughnessy, the drummer from <i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i>, visited us at our March camp. He played with the corps on “Summertime,” and later asked me if he could sign something for me. That autograph with the cover to my brass scores that summer still hangs on my wall to this day, with a personal note from Ed, which I am humbled by daily.</p>
                <p>Like anyone who was with us that summer, there are an infinite number of memories from that summer. Just a few that I love to relive, and I’m sure everyone from that year loves as well:</p>
                <p>In both 1991 and 1992, Frank Williams (a member of the Drum Corps International Hall Of Fame) was a brass consultant for the Colts. He was also the brass caption head for the The Cadets of Bergen County, and had made his appearance on the Drum Corps International stage with the incredible Suncoast Sound horn lines in the 1980s. He came in to guide us and answer questions about thing from daily teaching and warmup brass routines, to how to effectively hold a critique when trying to move up. One night in June, at a show in Michigan, Frank was there with The Cadets, who were on immediately before us. After our opening impact, Frank RAN back into the stadium and sat down next Dean Musson and I and proceeded to tell us how incredible the hornline looked and sounded.</p>
                <img src="/img/news/1993_mom.jpg" height="" width="200" alt="1993 Music On The March Program" class="alignright imageborder">
                <p>At our home show in Dubuque, the Colts celebrated our 30th anniversary and alumni from every era were there. As the corps performed, every impact was greeted with screams and every emotional moment held breathless attention. There were tears from alumni and looks of disbelief as the audience reveled in the best Colts they’d ever seen. It was no doubt a declarative performance that sent shock waves throughout the activity that night. I’ve still got a recording of the show, and it brings tears to my eyes to this day.</p>
                <p>In early August, we were in Kansas and had an exhibition show, as well as a big picnic with the Glassmen and the Railmen. The Glassmen had been our rival all season long, with us constantly leapfrogging each other in placement. That night, the Glassmen and Colts performed for each other, with the corps’ brass staff serving as judges. This relaxed evening showed both groups were truly in this activity for the right reasons, and were all doing this as friends. The evening was a rare chance for us to relax in the heat of a very competitive season.</p>
                <p>Finals week was a truly incredible experience for the corps. Heading into Quarterfinals, we had our sights set on The Velvet Knights. We hadn’t beaten them all season, and they were a crowd favorite. Fortunately, the crowd loved the Colts <i>even more</i>! We finished in 13th that day, but only 0.4 out of Finals. Returning to the housing site, we immediately got to work, knowing the next 48 hours would be a blur. There was no celebration, just a more determined corps. Celebrations are for when you’re done, and we weren’t done yet.</p>
                <p>On Friday, we kept our routines the same, knowing that routine was our friend and it had gotten us this far. One thing changed during Finals week - one thing which I think still made other corps scratch their heads. We warmed up in an area far away from the other corps. No one saw us do our thing. No one saw us prepare. We were an unknown. The busses pulled up to the stadium, the members filed off the busses in full uniform, and immediately headed to the starting line. The corps was as close to perfect as they were going to be, and they truly lit the place up.</p>
                <p>We all waited in the end zone - many members were too nervous to make eye contact. Staff shuffled their feed in the dirt. Brandt Crocker was announcing the scores (as he always does) and we held our breath as he started listing scores off. The Colts had already been announced at an 84.2 (our highest score to date). As Brandt slowly listed off the scores, we heard “The Velvet Knights… with a score of… 83 point…” and the rest was lost in the screams of joy from the corps. It wasn’t until later that night we realized we had tied with the Glassmen for 11th place. We knew that we had achieved a once-in-a-lifetime goal – put a drum corps from Dubuque, Iowa into DCI Finals. And, we did it as friends. We did it without tearing others down. We did it with joy. We did it through fierce determination and setting goals that were lofty.</p>
                <p>There’s a picture of us all next to one of the vans the day of Finals. It’s still one of my favorite pictures. I’ll always remember my friends from that year, the members, every minute on the road, and how much we learned, celebrated, built trust among ourselves, and set the standard for every future version of the Colts. I  will cherish that year, and that group of people, forever.</p>

                <p><i>March 1, 2018</i></p>
                <p>History was being made in drum corps 42 years ago this winter.  And our corps, in particular our winter guard, was the reason for it. There were 21 girls from Dubuque, with the exception of one, that had some raw talent. In essence, they were a diamond in the rough.</p>
                <p>In the late 1960’s, the corps color guard had made a name for itself. In the winters of 1970 and 1971, Colts Director and Hall of Famer Jim Killoran made efforts to start a winter guard. It was not until the fall of 1975, when Colts Hall of Famers Merle Mathis and Al Beckius sought to provide the opportunity for the color guard to be active in the winter months. With the able assistance of Tom Faulkner, they set out to find some able body person(s) to take on the role of developing a winter guard for the corps.</p>
                <p>The first candidate declined. His view was that these “farm girls” from Iowa did not have the skillset or ambition to make the effort worthwhile. However, that candidate did provide names of instructors who might be interested. The corps was directed to reach out to Steve Suslick and Wally Meissner. Both had marched and worked with the Cavaliers Color Guard.</p>
                <p>When Steve and Wally arrived at the first rehearsal, they were met by 21 naïve, happy go lucky young ladies. On rifle, there was Jody Bowman, Judy Delaney Cooper, Carol “Jelly” Jellison Sessions, Mary Sue “Eddie” Lange Crabtree, Patti “Tink” Mathis McClain, Dawn “Durf’ Murphy Carney, Joan McCann Vasquez. On flag, there was Ann Fangman Vrotsos, Chris “C.B.” Faulkner, Ellen “Alvin” Golinvaux, the late Lisa “Levi” Ingram, Vicki “Krooz” Kruser, Mary “Bubbles” Mathis, Robin “Space Cadet” Phillips, Janis “Cover Girl” Sanner, Lora “Crusher Schueller; and Cynthia “Shitmeg” Steichen. The American Flag Section of Teresa “Tess” Milligan, Deanne Mitchell Gibboney, and Donna “Teta” Engler Pluym.  Their commanding officer was Jolene “Trigger” Miller O’Toole. These young ladies, a majority who were only 15 and 16 years old, were met by two color guard visionaries with the technical skills and experience to match. The consensus after the first rehearsal was that Suslick was a “jerk.” It was not apparent to these young ladies, the first competitive winter guard in Colts history, that Suslick and Meissner saw something in them that they themselves did not envision.</p>
                <p>Steve and Wally demanded the best. They expected no less. When Steve and Wally were away, the onus of perfecting the show fell on the shoulders of corps color guard alumnus, Jane MacFarlane Kohl, Betty Wahlburn Cromartie, and Ellen Fangman McNichols. During the week, these three stalwarts continued the vision that Steve and Wally implemented.</p>
                <p>In January of 1976, the girls had several hurdles to overcome heading into the competitive season. They were young. They were inexperienced. They were the only guard that had to travel long distances to compete. Most shows were in the Milwaukee and Chicagoland area. In essence, the guard ventured into the lion’s den every weekend to compete against the powerhouses of the day: Kilts, Silhouettes, Guardsmen, Buccaneers, and Babcock Debs, to name a few. When most of the guards slept at their homes on Saturday night between competitions, the girls slept in hotels or a gym floor. Car-pooling was the norm, in which some of the guard members were designated driving duties. Trips to these areas back in the 1970’s were not like it is today. For the first time, winter guard shows were set to music. On top of that, the Colts Winter Guard was the new kid on the block. What was really expected of them their first season out?</p>
                <p>At the first show of the season, the Colts surprised quite a few folks. They came in third in Greenfield, Wisconsin. Mary “Bubbles” Mathis took first in in individual flag competition and Joan McCann Vasquez took sixth in individual rifle. The next day, the guard inched up to second place in Chicago, just 0.4 of a point behind the Kilts. Jolene “Trigger” Miller O’Toole was awarded Top Commanding Officer.</p>
                <p>The girls began to sense some animosity by the other guards. How can these upstart “farm girls” from Iowa get this credit for their first season out? A story has it that at one competition, Jody Bowman could not find one of her boots. There was a discussion amongst the guard that whomever was pulling the prank needed to return Jody’s boot. No boot was returned, and Jody went on to compete with a sock instead. After the competition, the boot reappeared with a message on the bottom of the boot saying something to the effect of, “Cow shits go home!” The guard sported a western theme uniform and two Kilts guard members, in an attempt to get under Jolene’s skin, began calling her “Trigger.” However, the nickname stuck and became a badge of honor for Jolene. Ironically, those two Kilts members eventually instructed the Colts color guard in the late 1970’s into the 1980’s, Kirt Kinyon and Dave Nelson.</p>
                                <img src="/img/news/1976_guard_2.jpg" height="" width="500" alt="1976 Winter Guard" class="alignright imageborder">

                <p>Instead of folding, these girls from Iowa fed off the jealousy, pushing themselves to prove that they were as good as the scores and placements dictated. Steve, Wally, and the rest of the staff gave them the product and know-how to be a top winter guard. A few weeks later, the guard won prelims in Racine, Wisconsin, topping a field of 20 other guards. Yet, at finals, they were beaten by the Silhouettes, whom had jumped up five spots and over eight points to win at finals. The guard was full of mixed emotions. Was politics in play? Did the other guard have a bad prelim show and just took it to everyone at finals? Feeling bummed, the guard headed to the next competition in Carpentersville, Illinois, via carpool. But things did not go smoothly. While the rest of the guard made it to the hotel, the Commanding Officer and Crusher were nowhere to be found. Their car went on a detour to Indiana. The two eventually made it to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
                <p>So how did these young girls react? Well, they won their next three competitions against the established powerhouses. Though the animosity remained, it began to wane as the other guards began to realize the Colts were a force to be reckoned with. In fact, the winter guard fans gave the girls from Dubuque “rock star” receptions at shows, to the degree that announcers at the shows were virtually drowned out by the reaction of the crowd when the Colts were announced. But would complacency set in? Come mid-March, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the guard came in sixth place. Suslick rewarded the girls with an extended rehearsal that evening in the gym.  You could hear a pin drop. The next day in Waukesha, the guard came in first. We have all heard the mantra “to be the best, you have to beat the best.” The rest of March saw the guard coming in short, placing second in the next three competitions.</p>
                <p>The Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championships (the precursor of WGI) was on the horizon. The Colts were definitely the dark horse in the competition. Would they accomplish what the staff suspected they could attain? Would they achieve what they never thought was possible at the beginning of the season? Would they get the respect and placement they worked for and deserved?</p>
                <p>Sitting first after prelims, a concern was in the back of their minds that what happened in Racine earlier in the year could happen again: that they could be usurped and not take home the gold. Adding to the tension was a dilemma. You see, throughout the season there were seven rifles, but only six positions in the drill.  At each competition, one of the six would sit out a show. And one person, Judy Delaney Cooper, had to learn the drill and the counts for the rifle work for each of the six positions and would fill in for each of the other rifles when it was their turn to sit out a competition. But who was going to sit out for the Championship?</p>
                <p>That decision was placed on the rifle line. They had to choose amongst themselves who would sit out of the most important show of the season. The gold medal was on the line. Mary Sue “Eddie” Lange Crabtree unselfishly took the hit. To make up for it, Deanne Mitchell Gibboney offered up her position in the American Flag Section at retreat to allow Mary Sue to be on the floor when the final scores were announced.</p>
                <p>Ten of the 29 guards from prelims advanced to finals. There were six placement changes from prelims to finals.  “In fourth Place with, 0.1 in penalties, and a final score of 86.567.... Kilts.  In third place, with 0.3 in penalties, with a final score of 87.933… Silhouettes.” The tension was building. Would the wildest dreams of Suslick and Meissner bring these “farm girls” from Iowa to the top of the color guard world? Would these girls from Iowa reach a goal that they never thought fathomable just a few months earlier? “In second place, with 0.3 in penalties, with a score of 88.800...”  Oh, would that penalty cause us a Championship? Would we be judged for what we did and not where we are from? “... The Guardsmen.” On April 10, 1976, the Colts Winter Color Guard was announced the 1976 Midwest Color Guard Circuit Champions with a score of 89.534. (and no penalties).</p>
                <p>This was just a tip of the iceberg of what the guard achieved in 1976. We would like to thank the 1976 guard members and Al Beckius, who we were able to contact for this write-up. There were numerous antidotes that we just could not get into this story. We could write a book about this remarkable group of young women. Speaking with them today, one could feel the esprit de corps that exudes. What they accomplished as young women can be sensed in what they have accomplished in the rest of their lives. They are a very special group of folks. If you want to know more, make sure you make it to the alumni festivities to celebrate the corps 55th Anniversary on July 13, 2018, in Dubuque, and get your chance to speak with members of the 1976 Winter Guard.</p>

                <p><i>February 1, 2018</i></p>
                <p>Last month, the Colts wrapped up their formal audition process for the 2018 season. The Colts saw incredible turn out this year as students auditioned for one of the limited 154 positions in the corps. This year, the Colts hosted eight events in November, December, and January, as well as video auditions for color guard. New this season were one-day audition camps in St. Louis, Missouri for brass; Tampa, Florida for color guard; Miami, Florida for brass; and San Antonio, Texas for percussion. By increasing the number of audition locations, the Colts were able to audition more students, make drum corps more accessible for more students, and bring the unique Colts experience to a wider range students.</p>
				<p>November camp, over the Thanksgiving weekend, had a near-record turn out of students auditioning in brass, percussion, and color guard. <!-- Following the camp, over 70 contracts were offered, thanks to a combination of strong veteran retention and a high level of talent from new students.--> Auditions continued quickly after, with every weekend in December except Christmas having a Colts audition event. Throughout the four one-day audition camps, attendance remained strong and brought in a great pool of students for auditions. As is the Colts tradition, the December camp for brass and percussion in Dubuque fell on one of the coldest and snowiest weekends of the winter. Highs on Sunday were only negative seven, without the wind chill!</p>
                <p>In January, the Colts again hosted an audition and reherasal in San Antonio, Texas. By doing a second event in Texas, it allowed the percussion to have a full rehearsal as they would in Dubuque, but without every student having to pay for a flight. The next weekend was a three day camp in Dubuque at the Five Flags Center, the Colts favorite winter home. Following the January camp, nearly all positions in the brass and percussion section have been filled, with color guard spots still open for April.</p>
                <p>This month, the Colts will host a brass only camp in the Dubuque area the weekend of February 16 - 18. March will not have a camp, due to the growing intensity of guard, percussion, and wind indoor groups through Winter Guard International. All three sections will be back together again in Dubuque the weekend of April 27 - 29 for a final rehearsal weekend before summer starts. April will also allow the Colts to contract the remaining color guard. The percussion and color guard will move in on May 20, the brass will join on May 25, and the season will be underway!</p>

                <p>Membership in the Colt Cadets is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no formal audition to be a member, but students are expected to be strong team players with a desire to be great! These rehearsals are approached as clinics, so any young person can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to experience a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best.</p>
                <p>During the summer, the Colt Cadets will perform about 25 times between mid-June and mid-August for more than 75,000 people across the Midwest.

                <p>All instruments, uniforms, and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of their summer membership fees through our sponsorship program.</p>

Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly.</p>
				<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp.

We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.

                </ul>
                <b>If this is your second camp, you do not need to submit an application, medical history form, or headshot (unless your information has changed!). However, you will still need to submit an <a href="/rsvp" target="_blank">RSVP</a> for this camp.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on which you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the day. If this is your second camp, do not forget to bring your audition t-shirt! Replacement t-shirts can be purchased at check-in for $10.00.<br><br>
                <br>
                Percussion: Bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad. Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest. Front ensemble students may, but are not required to, perform a short segment from a personal selection. We will provide all instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
Positions are open in all sections of the corps. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year, or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly.</p>
				<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
                <p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else. You can pay your fees by cash or check, or by card online at the <a href="https://store.colts.org/collections/summer-fees" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming rehearsal, you must be in touch with <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> and your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the camp is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting for parents will be held Sunday morning at 9:45 a.m. in a location to be announced. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the day.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the camp. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
