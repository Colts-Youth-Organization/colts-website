                The Colts do not provide transportation to or from the Houston airports for this event. The school is relatively close to both Houston airports, so services like UBER, Lyft, or taxi should be available and relatively inexpensive. You should still include all flight details on your RSVP. If you need help finding a ride to camp please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can also let us know if you have extra room or if you need assistance on your <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a>. </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>PARKING</b><br>
                Parking is available on campus throughout the day. Specific parking details will be available soon!</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>CAMP PAPERWORK</b><br>
                Prior to camp, you will be expected to turn in:<br>
                <ul>
					<li><a href="rsvp.html" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. Regardless of your plans, submit an RSVP so we can keep you up to date. Be sure to include all necessary flight and travel information in the RSVP. If you need a ride from the airport, you will be notified by the Thursday immediately before the camp who will be picking you up. The RSVP should be submitted each month by interested students.</li>
					<li><a href="memberapp.html" target="_blank">Member Application</a>. Submit your application in advance to save time at check in. All auditioning students <b>must</b> submit a member application. The application only needs to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes</li>
                    <li>Email a head shot of yourself to <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last), section, and which audition camp you are attending. This picture is added to your audition file so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. This picture must be submitted before the camp starts and is required of all attending. Make sure the image is clear, well lit, and contains your whole face. And, as great as your sunglasses or Snapchat filters may look, they don't belong in your head shot.</li>
				</ul>
                When you arrive to check in, bring with you:<br>
                <ul>
                	<li><a href="documents/MedicalForm2020.pdf" target="_blank">Colts Medical History Form</a>. This form is <b>required</b> in order to audition. The medical form also provides permission to participate in our activities. Students 18 or older may sign their own medical form. Any student 17 or younger must have a parent or guardian signature to participate. Medical forms only need to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes. Be sure to complete both sides!</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the day. <b>Don't forget to bring a water bottle!</b><br>
                Color Guard: Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), <b>your own flag, rifle, and/or sabre</b>, and knee pads (definitely recommended). There is no need to purchase any special equipment for rehearsals. You will wear your audition t-shirt for all rehearsal segments through the day.<br>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
All positions in the corps are open. Following the event, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly. Recall auditions can be scheduled three weeks after your initial audition at one of our events. Attend early and attend often for your best chance at a position in the Colts.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting for parents will be held Sunday morning at 11:00 a.m. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the day.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the camp. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
