                <p>The Colts are excited to announce their brass team will be returning for the 2020 season. The team will be led by Brass Caption Head <b>Chad Miller</b> and Brass Arranger <b>Michael Miller</b> and brings with them experience from a wide range of backgrounds spanning several decades of performing, designing, adjudicating, and instructing. They are all very excited to continue building on the past successes of the Colts brass program.</p>
                <p>“The brass staff will be returning for their fourth year and we couldn’t be more excited," said Brass Caption Head Chad Miller. "You’ll never meet a group of educators that enjoy working together as much as this group. With an emphasis on good fundamental approach and a positive experience for the members, this brass team is ready to take the growth of the Colts hornline to the next level this season.”</p>
                <p>The brass team includes <b>Tom Lizotte</b>, <b>Justin Diaz</b>, <b>Matthew Lagarde</b>, <b>Steve Lyons</b>, <b>Zack Crissman</b>, and <b>David Abrams</b>. New to the Colts brass team this year is <b>Kara Metzger</b>. Kara is currently pursuing her Masters in Music at University of Minnesota Duluth and was a member of the Colts from 2011 - 2015. In 2016, she began teaching the Colt Cadets, and has served as brass caption head since 2017. Kara will continue working with Colt Cadets while also stepping onto Colts tour.</p>
