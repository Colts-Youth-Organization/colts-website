<p>Last week, Colts parent Craig Nowack captured a unique perspective of of the drum corps activity - the line at the cook truck! The goal of the Colts cook truck is to feed 200 people in 20 minutes or less four times a day, and it can be a big undertaking. Some tips from the more experienced Colts cooks include always pre stage 12 - 15 plates, count your plates so you know how many people are left to feed, and make sure there's always enough for left overs! You can watch the time-lapse of the serving of a meal <a href="https://youtu.be/miiFr7Pm5Ls" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
