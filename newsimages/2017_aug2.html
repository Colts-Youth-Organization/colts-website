The experiences of both the Colts and Colt Cadets this season are certainly one for the memory books. The Colts expanded their tour to a wider range of states this summer, traveling more miles and bringing the magic of <b>Both Sides Now</b> to more fans. The Colt Cadets honored their legacy and 50 years in the activity with a trip down <b>The River's Edge</b>. Both corps this summer rose to new heights and took on new challenges with passion, commitment, dedication, and excitement.</p>

<p>Every year, the Colts and Colt Cadets purchase new equipment from the Yamaha Corporation of America. Following the seaon, we are able to sell these gently-used brass, percussion, and keyboard instruments at very competitive prices. We currently have baritones, tubas, 4-1/2 octave marimbas, vibraphones, and more available for immediate delivery.</p>
<p>We are also taking reservations now for our full line of brass instruments (trumpets, mellophones, baritones, euphoniums, and tubas) and front ensemble equipment (4-1/2 and 4-1/3 octave marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, concert toms, and bell sets). These will be available for delivery following the end of our next season in August 2018.</p>
<p>To find out more about available instruments and prices, contact Vicki MacFarlane, Colts Director, via email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, August 9, the Colts and Colt Cadets gathered together with friends, family, volunteers, and alumni for the annual awards and recognition banquet. The banquet was a time to recognize the achievements of very successful seasons in both drum corps, as well as the outstanding contributions of both members and volunteers.</p>
