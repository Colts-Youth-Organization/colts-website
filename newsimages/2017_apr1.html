<p>As winter turns to spring and the excitement of summer draws nearer, the Colts are excited to announce an exciting step forward into a new era of Colts history. World-renowned uniform designer <a href="http://www.fjminc.com/cesario-drumcorps#tab1" target="_blank">Michael Cesario</a> created a <b>BOLD NEW LOOK</b> for the 2017 Colts.</p>
            <p>Upon learning of the possibility of new Colts uniforms in 2017, an anonymous donor approached Board President Peter Hansen with a commitment to provide 1/3 of the cost of the uniforms</p>
            <p>In turn, Peter challenged the Colts Board of Directors to personally match the initial contribution. The Board rose to the occasion with a commitment that exceeded the original anonymous pledge.</p> 
            <p><b>NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP!</b> Each $85 gift provides the final 1/3 of the cost to outfit one member of the drum corps. Please join us in this effort to bring a NEW VISION to the Colts, and move the corps forward in style! When you pledge $85 or more to the <b>2017 Colts Uniform Campaign</b> we will e-mail you a complete, full=color rendering of Michael Cesario's sketch via email in thanks for your gift!</p>
            <p>To donate to the <b>2017 Colts Uniform Campaign</b>, you can click the image. To learn more about the new uniforms, and the history of the Colts uniforms, you can <a href="http://colts.org/uniforms.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
