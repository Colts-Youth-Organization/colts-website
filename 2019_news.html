		</div>
	</div>
    
    			<p><i>July 21, 2019</i></p>
				
				<p><p>The Colts Youth Organization was recently honored to receive a Cultural Leadership Partner Operating Support Grant from the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. The organization received a grant award of $20,000. This is the second year of a three-year grant cycle.</p>
				<p>Cultural Leadership Partners demonstrate their investment in a rich cultural environment that improves the quality of life for all Iowans. Partners are selected every three years and receive grant funds to support operating costs throughout the three-year cycle. The Colts were selected because of their exemplary record of programming, managerial excellence and community service on a year-round basis to the citizens of Iowa.</p>
				<p>“Iowa is becoming known as a culturally vibrant state with world-class arts and cultural offerings, where engaging experiences revitalize communities with unique characteristics and local charm,” said Chris Kramer, director of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. "These projects represent Iowa as a place that values the creative sector as an economic driver, contributing to a productive business climate and a diversified economy."</p>
				<p>Research shows that investments in arts and culture — in museums, performances and historic buildings, for example — help communities boost tourism, attract businesses, retain workers and improve the overall quality of life for residents. Accordingly, the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs helps Iowans invest in the people, places and points of pride that define our state.</p>
				<p>The Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs announced in late June that it has awarded more than $2.1 million in grants for art, film, history and culture. The state agency also designated or redesignated 22 communities as Iowa Great Places or Cultural and Entertainment Districts.</p>
				<p>Colts programs serve young people who desire high levels of challenge, achievement and success and they carry an expectation that members are committed to hard work and dedication. The organization has been in continuous existence since their founding in 1963. The Colts are proud to represent Iowans across the country each summer as "Iowa's Ambassadors of Music."</p>

                <p>These honorees join 56 previous inductees in the Colts Hall Of Fame, which was established on the corps' 30th anniversary in 1993 to recognize and honor alumni members, design and instructional staff, administrators, board members, contributors, or volunteers whose history of outstanding contributions to the Colts has played a significant and long-term role in our organization and in the marching arts.</p>

                <p>The Colts were saddened to hear of the passing of longtime board member and Colts Hall of Fame Class of 2017 inductee Tom Reilly. For over 20 years, Tom worked behind the scenes to raise money and provide financial guidance to the Colts Youth Organization. Tom became a member of the Board of Directors in 2008 and continued to provide guidance to the organization through various committees and projects. The entire Colts organization is thankful for Tom's service and is sending love and positive thoughts to Tom's family.

                <p><i>June 15, 2019</i></p>
                <p>When the <a href="https://dradubuque.com" target="_blank">Dubuque Racing Association</a> announced their grant awards to local nonprofit organizations this year, the Colts Youth Organization was pleased to learn it received $5,000 for the purchase of a new Thermo King refrigeration unit for the Colts mobile kitchen. This was the 23rd consecutive year that the Colts received a grant from the DRA. The Dubuque Racing Association (DRA) is the nonprofit license holder for Q Casino and Diamond Jo Casino. Grants have been offered to area nonprofit organizations through a competitive submission process since 1985.</p>
				<p>Last year, a grant for technology equipment for the Colts conference room transformed the way the organization conducts board meetings. A full audio/video suite was added so board members participating from areas outside of Dubuque are able to stay engaged in the dialog throughout the monthly meetings.</p>
				<p>In the past few years, the Colts received grants from the DRA that assisted with the purchase of a custom tent for our souvenir marketplace, percussion equipment for the Colts Cadets, and new uniforms for both corps in their 50th anniversary season in 2013.</p>		
				<p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $385,000 for new instruments, uniforms, vehicles and trailers, computers, and building improvements.</p>
				<p>Thank you to the DRA for continuing to support the vision of the Colts Youth Organization and our mission to "use music & excellence to teach other about success in life."</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Annual Car Wash Fundraiser</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
    
    			<p><i>June 6, 2019</i></p>
                <p>The 240 members of the Colts and Colt Cadets will be practicing more than music on Saturday, June 8, as they instead become experts at washing cars! 19 simultaneous locations will be staffed with members of both corps from 9:00 a.m to 4:00 p.m. for the annual Colts Car Wash fundraiser. Since the inception of this program in 1985, over $350,000 has been raised for summer travel expenses of the Colts and Colt Cadets.</p>
    <p>Last year, the groups washed over 750 cars and earned over $46,000 in donations and paid pledges. Proceeds from the car wash will be used for summer tour costs. Increased prices for diesel and food will be a real challenge this summer, and the car wash helps get the two groups down the road.</p>
    <p>The car wash is free, with donations accepted. There is no minimum donation expected. The weather looks to be a great day for a car wash - sunny and a high of 80 - so be sure to stop at one of the many locations around Dubuque!</p>
    <p>The Colts would like to extend a big <b>THANK YOU</b> to our host sites! The car wash would not be successful without the warm welcome we receive from these businesses.</p>

                Parents and students from out-of-town coming in Dubuque further than two hours away are able to check in at Washington Middle School starting at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, June 7. The address for the school is 51 N Grandview Ave, Dubuque, IA 52001. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/george+washington+middle+school+dubuque+iowa/@42.4925996,-90.6898876,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x87e32c6da624ff1f:0x68c4e04b727b8ada!8m2!3d42.4925998!4d-90.6876989" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a Google Map of the facility. A light snack will be set out that evening, and lights out will be at 11:00 p.m. Students will sleep in the cafeteria, and parents can stay in a separate room.

                <p>Wake up at Washington Middle School will be at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday, June 8. Those staying at the school will eat breakfast and pack a sack lunch for the day. All luggage and equipment brought in for Colt Cadets must be fully packed up and put on the far side of the cafeteria. Between 7:45 and 8:15 a.m., any Colt Cadets students may drop off their luggage at the school before continuing on to the car wash site. Only students that stayed overnight at the school will be provided transportation by Colts vehicles to their car wash sites to arrive by 9:00 a.m. Car wash is from 9:00 a.m to 4:00 p.m. Students arriving on Saturday should bring their own sack lunch, and students should stagger their 30 minute lunch breaks in the middle of the day. It is very important to wear sunscreen, especially on your feet! Also, be sure to drink lots of water to hydrate for the intense heat this weekend.</p>
                <p>After 4:00 p.m, Colt Cadets students may be picked up and returned to Washington Middle School in the same way they were dropped off. If you need special arrangements or help with this, contact Andrew Eaton at <a href="mailto:andrew@colts.org">andrew@colts.org</a>.

                <p>Featuring the music of AC/DC, Robert W. Smith, Camille Saint-Saens, Frederic Chopin, and Bob Dylan, the Colts <strong>explore the depths and dualities</strong> of a place one hopes to never know. In the struggle, there is light. Beyond the inferno, there is ice. Yet <strong>no soul is so forsaken</strong> that it cannot <strong>find its way to heaven's door.</strong> The Colts are proud to present their 2019 program... <strong>When Hell Freezes Over.</strong></p>

                Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend.

Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here. Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand. The Colt Cadets staff will also be available throughout the weekend to answer any questions you may have about the drum corps experience, what we do, and how we do it.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school or stay in a hotel. For all events, we recommend the <a href="https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="_blank">Hampton Inn</a> for your stay in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a>, select the front desk, and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.

                <p><i>May 3, 2019</i></p>
                
                <p>The Colts Youth Organization and Ultimate Drill Book are excited to continue their partnership for 2019 and beyond. UDB is at the forefront of incorporating technology into the marching arts. Through the UDB app, students, staff, and designers are able to have the most updated drill charts with them at all times. By combining traditional styles of learning drill with the most modern technology available, UDB allows for a heightened learning experience for every student. Every student in Colts and Colt Cadets is also provided with a pre-printed dot book for dots, music, and any special notes about the drill sets. Learn more about Ultimate Drill Book online at <a href="https://ultimatedrillbook.com" target="_blank">ultimatedrillbook.com</a></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>   
                <p>"I love our relationship with Ultimate Drill Book," said Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane. "The impact the tools have on our students are profound. The members love learning with UDB and the staff loves teaching with it. The program is incredibly easy to use, but it's also had the most significant impact on the learning process I've seen in the past decade. Last year, we were able to start using the program with Colts, and everyone is very excited to be able to use the program at an even higher level this year."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>         
                <p>"I think Ultimate Drill Book will be a game changer for the Colt Cadets this year," said Colt Cadets Director Andrew Eaton. "I'm looking forward to seeing our members and staff dive into the program. We are all advocates for UDB. A majority of our members are in high school marching band and will be able to bring the things they learn through UDB back to their band programs at home."</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>         
                <p>"Partnering with the Colts Youth Organization is a natural fit for us," said Luke Gall at Ultimate Drill Book. "We care deeply about the marching arts, and both the Colts and Colt Cadets consistently provide high quality, positive educational experiences to marchers of all ages. We couldn’t be more proud to be working with Vicki, Andrew, and the entire Colts team!"</p>

                <p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br>
                These parts were included in your contract payments and will be handed out at Move Ins. Each brass and battery member receives a member shirt and marching shoes (brass, cymbals, and DM also receive gloves). Guard members receive shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag, and other necessary personal items.</p>

                <p><b>CAR WASH: JUNE 8, 2019</b><br>
                This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>
                <p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 8.</p>
                <p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $50,000 in our one-day event! It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas, and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones. The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p>
                <p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge will end up being around $7.50. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received. We collect these payments through the office by mail or online. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5.00. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p>
                <p>For donations and pledges collected and turned in prior at move ins, members who collect and turn in $225 or more will receive a $25 gift card to the souvie stand. Members who collect and turn in $300 or more will get a $50 gift card to the souvie stand.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
    
    			<p><i>April 2, 2019</i></p>
                <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kugsiXXNSJw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="alignleft imageborder"></iframe>
                <p>The Colts Youth Organization and Fruhauf Uniforms are excited to announce a partnership for 2019 and beyond. The Colts will exclusively wear Fruhauf uniforms, becoming the third Drum Corps International World Class corps to do so. The Fruhauf team will work closely with the Colts design team to bring a unique and memorable uniform to the field every year, made possible by the unparalleled Fruhauf level of service. The Colt Cadets will begin wearing Fruhauf uniforms in 2020, becoming the first Open Class corps to do so. <a href="https://fruhauf.com" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about Fruhauf Uniforms.</a></p>
                <p>"From our very first meeting with the Fruhauf team — Richard, Kenny, and Landon — we felt immediately at home,” said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. “To be honest, their history and legacy in the uniform industry was a bit of a surprise to me. But their vision for creating pieces that work in tandem with the corps program designers feels very fresh to me. The move to Fruhauf opens up an opportunity for the Colts to begin a new era in our long, drum corps history.”</p>
                <p>"I am ecstatic about our partnership with Fruhauf!" said Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane. "While I have always admired their work, their attention to detail and care of employees stood out to me on our initial visit. Their capability and capacity to fulfill visions in-house is amazing and uncommon. Their designers have an ability to combine modern methods with traditional looks; every experience is one of a kind. We look forward to an incredible partnership that ultimately benefits each and every member that wears the Fruhauf name."</p>
                <p>“On behalf of the entire Fruhauf family, we could not be more excited about partnering with an organization who is dedicated to life on the field, excellence in music education, and an unwavering passion for the arts. We are proud to welcome the Colts to the Fruhauf Family!”</p>

    			<img src="/img/news/CIB_Ankeny.jpg" height="" width="250" alt="Celebration In Brass 2019" class="alignleft imageborder">
                <p><i>March 7, 2019</i></p>
                <p>In 2019, the annual drum corps show <i>Celebration In Brass</i> will return to Ankeny, Iowa. The show has its historic roots in Ankeny, with the first drum corps performance in the town taking place in 1982. Ankeny hosted the event for over 25 years, where the show became a staple summer event for drum corps fans in the Des Moines area. In 2019, the Colts are partnering with the <a href="https://ankenybands.com/ankeny-instrumental-music-foundation/" target="_blank">Ankeny Instrumental Music Foundation</a> to host the show. Established in 1999, the foundation supports the band programs in both Ankeny High School and Ankeny Centennial High School.</p>
                <p>Brandt Crocker, DCI Hall of Famer and "The Voice Of DCI" since 1972, has been with <i>Celebration In Brass</i> since its first year.</p>
                <p>"The show really had a small beginning," said Brandt. "There was a guy in town who ran a tire shop and, someway or another, he knew about drum corps. He happened to also be on the Ankeny Area Chamber Of Commerce and brought the idea of hosting a drum corps show to the Chamber in the fall of 1981. The Chamber then approached DCI and started setting everything up. Shortly after the contract was signed, I got a call from the DCI office asking me to work with the Chamber to make sure everything went well."</p>
                <p>"With all the prep work completed, we were all ready for what looked like was going to be a great event. I was there to announce the show and oversee the day-of operations. Unfortunately, the weather had other plans. The first year was dominated by storms and a mini-tornado that blew through the north end zone of the stadium. In those days, we didn't have any real weather policies, so we kept moving the crowd between the school's gym and the stadium, hoping to have the show go on. Eventually, we called the show, with only one corps being able to perform. However, a spark had been lit within the Chamber, and they were committed to the idea of hosting a drum corps show. We came back next year and had perfect weather. Over the years, the show developed a massive following in the community and we generally had around 3,500 people in the stands. The community loved the drum corps activity and loved seeing the performances every summer. The corps always enjoyed coming to Ankeny as well — we had some great housing sites and the crowd response was always top-notch."</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p>A couple years after the Ankeny Chamber dropped out due to a change in the DCI tour schedule, the Colts brought a show back to the Des Moines metro. Originally named <i>Summer Showdown</i> to tie into the fall marching band festival at West Des Moines Valley High School, the event was held for two years in Valley Stadium before moving to Waukee. In 2011, the regular DCI tour stop resumed the long-standing name <i>Celebration In Brass</i> in partnership with the Waukee Band Boosters. <i>Celebration In Brass</i> then moved to Johnston High School in 2017 due to a stadium conflict in Waukee, and now this year the long-overdue return to Ankeny.</p>
                <p>“We’re thrilled to have an opportunity to reunite with Ankeny for <i>Celebration In Brass</i>,” said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. "The school district has been fully supportive — from the superintendent and facilities people to the band directors — everyone is excited to see if we can rekindle the magic of drum corps in Ankeny. I remember coming here in 2004 when my son marched in Colt Cadets, and while the setting will be familiar, the stadium has been completely remodeled and will provide a perfect setting for a good ol’ Midwest drum corps show. Not to mention, the corps line up is fantastic.”</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p>Christian Baughman, Colts alumnus and instrumental music instructor for Ankeny Community Schools, is working closely with the Colts and the Ankeny Instrumental Music Foundation to coordinate the show.</p>
                <p>"30 years ago, in the summer of 1989, my high school ‘band buddy’ picked up an incoming freshman who knew nothing about drum corps, let alone marching band, and brought me to
<i>Celebration In Brass</i>," said Christian. "That experience put me on a path that would eventually lead me to join the Colts in the summer of 1991. The following school year, I had an English teacher who shared my passion for music, the trumpet, and drum and bugle corps.  I went on to become the drum major of the Colts, major in music education, and become a band director. Eleven years ago, I joined the band staff in Ankeny and three years later my former English teacher, Dr. Bruce Kimpston, became our superintendent. Like so many others in our community, we have both been eagerly anticipating the return of <i>Celebration In Brass</i> to Ankeny."</p>
				<p>"I know that somewhere in that crowd this July there will be another kid who will be just as awestruck as I was that night all those years ago. That kid will end up following a dream that was ignited by the power, precision, and excellence that is competitive drum and bugle corps. This kid’s experiences may be repeated hundreds of times, and in this way the show will further the Ankeny Instrumental Music Foundation’s goal to elevate the skills and knowledge of every student musician to the highest level possible. I could not be more proud to help present this event with the cooperation of the AIM Foundation, the Ankeny Community Schools, and the Colts. These organizations are all world class in their own right. The audience and participating corps are in for a very special event on July 10!"</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p>"For 2019, I'm very happy the show is back in Ankeny," said Brandt. "The community here still remembers the event, so I'm sure they'll be very excited to have drum corps back in their town as well. The renovated Ankeny Stadium will be great for the show — there's now a turf field and the stands now face east, so the setting sun won't be in everyone's eyes. I'm looking forward to being the contest coordinator for the great line up at <i>Celebration In Brass</i> this year."</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p><i>Celebration In Brass</i> will be held on Wednesday, July 10, at Ankeny Stadium At Northview Middle School. This year’s show features eight corps in DCI competition. In addition to the hosts Colts and Colt Cadets, <i>Celebration In Brass</i> is thrilled to welcome the 2018 World Class Champion Santa Clara Vanguard from Santa Clara, CA; the 2016 World Class Champion Bluecoats from Canton, OH; last year’s first-time DCI Finalist Mandarins from Sacramento, CA; as well as the Blue Stars from La Crosse, WI; The Academy from Tempe, AZ; and River City Rhythm from Anoka, MN. <b><a href="http://store.colts.org/Celebration-In-Brass_c_37.html" target="_blank">Tickets are available for purchase online!</a></b> Tickets are assigned according to the date/time orders are received.

                <p>Membership in the Colt Cadets is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no formal audition to be a member, but students are expected to be strong team players with a desire to be great! These rehearsals are approached as clinics, so any student can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to experience a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best.</p>
                <p>During the summer, the Colt Cadets will perform about 25 times between mid-June and mid-August for more than 75,000 people across the Midwest. In 2019, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships.</p>
                <p>All instruments, uniforms, and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of their summer membership fees through our sponsorship program.</p>

                Prior to camp, you will be expected to turn in:<br>
                <ul>
					<li><a href="/rsvp" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. Regardless of your plans, submit an RSVP so we can keep you up to date. Be sure to include all necessary flight and travel information in the RSVP.

                    <li>Email a headshot of yourself to <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last), section, and which audition camp you are attending. This picture is added to your audition file so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. This picture must be submitted before the camp starts and is required of all attending. Make sure the image is clear, well lit, and contains your whole face. And, as great as your sunglasses or Snapchat filters may look, they don't belong in your headshot.</li>
				</ul>
                When you arrive to check in on Friday, bring with you:<br>
                <ul>
                	<li><a href="/documents/MedicalForm2019.pdf" target="_blank">Colts Medical History Form</a>. This form is <b>required</b> in order to audition.

Any student 17 or younger must have a parent or guardian signature to participate. Medical forms only need to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes. Be sure to complete both sides!</li>
                </ul>
                <b>If this is your second or more camp, you do not need to submit an application, medical history form, or headshot (unless your information has changed!). However, you will still need to submit an <a href="/rsvp" target="_blank">RSVP</a> for this camp.</b></p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Students stay overnight in the arena on the floor, as you will all summer. Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans), and tennis shoes (no high tops). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the weekend. <b>Don't forget to bring a water bottle!</b><br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you have absolutely no access to an instrument and need one provided, contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest. You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude, or excerpt you feel comfortable with. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group<br>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
Limited positions are open in the brass line. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership or provisional membership or 2) a suggestion to come back again next year, or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly.</p>
				<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
                <p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else. You can pay your fees by cash or check, or by card online at the <a href="http://store.colts.org/Summer-Fees_c_29.html" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                There is no parent meeting scheduled for this event, but Vicki, Jason, and Andrew will be available throughout the weekend to answer any questions you may have about Colts or Colt Cadets. Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen or check in table are great places to start with questions anytime you visit about where you can help.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
		<br>

		</div>
	</div>
    
    			<img src="/img/news/logo_clarke.jpg" height="" width="250" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
                <p><i>January 19, 2019</i></p>
                <p>A few snowflakes were starting to fall outside on Friday night as students finished unloading the equipment trailer. Inside Five Flags Center, the main lobby was packed with students and parents checking in for the camp weekend on one end, and athletic training students from Clarke University on the other. The athletic training students gathered together to go over a few last minute details with <b>Dr. Dee Higgins, PhD,</b> director of the Clarke University Athletic Training Program, before splitting up and making themselves available for Colts students. Now in its sixth year, this unique partnership with Clarke University allows Colts students the opportunity to have a full orthopedic and flexibility screening prior to the season, while also providing valuable hands-on experience for the students from Clarke.</p>
                <p>"The orthopedic and flexibility screenings we're able to provide for the Colts can do so much to help the students have a successful season," said Dr. Higgins. "Having the opportunity to sit with someone trained in athletic training and a greater understanding of how the body works in sports allows them to ask questions and receive feedback they may not get otherwise. For Clarke students, it's great exposure to the marching arts, while also providing them hands-on experience that is so crucial for future professionals in the athletic training field."</p>
                <img src="/img/news/MA_Logo.jpg" height="" width="330" alt="" class="alignright imageborder">
                <p>Also on site Friday night was <b>Dr. Steve Rock, MD,</b> a member of Medical Associates Orthopedic & Sports Medicine department. Dr. Rock is the forefront expert on concussions in the performing arts and works closely with <a href="http://athletesandthearts.com" target="_blank">Athletes and the Arts</a> to bring the world of marching arts and sports medicine together. In collaboration with Athletes and the Arts, Dr. Rock recently wrote a chapter in "Performing Arts Medicine" by Lauren E. Elson (Elsevier Publishers) titled, <i>Care of the Marching Musician</i>.</p>
                <p>"We've learned that about 80% of physical issues which may arise during a drum corps season are pre-exisiting conditions we can address readily and safely this time of year," said Dr. Rock. "By providing the Colts this one-on-one time with athletic trainers, we are able to identify potential issues with the time to react and assure a successful season. This gives everyone time to create plans for issues that may arise over the season, allowing the student to arrive at move ins as prepared and healthy as possible."</p>
                <p>Dr. Higgins and Dr. Rock have been involved with the Colts organization since 2009, providing resources, feedback, and ideas to the Colts and Colt Cadets students and staff on a wide variety of scenarios that may arise in a drum corps season. In 2016, Colts added an athletic trainer to the tour staff, and in 2017 Colt Cadets added a health and wellness coordinator to the tour staff. These staff members, along with Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane and Colt Cadets Director Andrew Eaton, communicate regularly with Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins about the various needs of students while on tour. In 2014, the Colts received a grant from Medical Associates Foundation to fund a three-year medical research project to study the effects of the drum corps activity on students. This study provided information on the physical demands students experience during a season of drum corps, allowing Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins to target their efforts to where students need them most. This study also heightened the Colts awareness of the caloric intake of students, leading to a restructuring of the food program for both corps to help provide sufficient calories to stay healthy throughout a drum corps season. <a href="/2014_news#93" target="_blank">Read more about this grant and study here</a>.</p>
                <p>"Our partnership with Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins has been a game-changer for the experience of our members," said Vicki MacFarlane. "It's taken several seasons to build the level of awareness and trust we have, but we are very proud of where we are as an organization now. Seeing first-hand the success stories of our students who have finished their seasons has been wonderful. Everything is a work in progress, and our ultimate goal is to just be better today than the we were the day before."</p>
                <p>Last September, Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins presented to all World Class drum corps directors at the annual <a href="https://www.dci.org/news/comprehensive-strategic-systemic-performer-and-organizational-wellness-is-central-focus-at-fall-meeting-of-dci-organizations" target="_blank">Drum Corps International September Meeting</a> in Phoenix. Their presentation and discussions with the voting membership helped lay the groundwork for the <a href="https://www.dci.org/news/dci-will-focus-on-health-wellness-and-safety-aspects-of-all-activities-during-upcoming-organization-wide-annual-meeting" target="_blank">Here’s to Our Health: Drum Corps International’s 2019 Annual Meetings and Activity-Wide Health, Wellness & Safety Summit</a> that took place in January in Indianapolis. In April, when the color guard and percussion students from Texas join the corps in Dubuque, Dr. Higgins, Dr. Rock, and the Clarke University athletic training students will again be on site to provide orthopedic and flexibility screenings for Colts students.</p>
                <p>Returning for her second year as athletic trainer for the Colts will be <b>Jennifer Pohlman,  LAT, ATC</b>. Jen is a graduate of Clarke University and helped with several years of the Colts orthopedic screenings before signing on for a full season with the corps. "My first season as athletic trainer with the Colts was a phenomenal experience," said Jen. "Being able to graduate and then jump right into my profession, while still working closely with Dr. Higgins, has given me such a strong foundation. Every day brought something new while on tour, but all the students and staff were so fun and easy going, and it made my job so enjoyable. I'm very excited to be back in 2019 with the corps." <a href="/people-staff-colts#tour" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read Jen's full bio.</p>
                 <p>“We love being able to showcase the strong medical and athletic training communities we have in Dubuque,” said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. “At our rehearsal weekends, we welcome parents and students from around the country, and even overseas, so having all our guests see first-hand the connectivity we have to the greater Dubuque community no doubt benefits the Colts, but also shines a light on Clarke University and Medical Associates. We’ve had Colts or Colt Cadets alumni who have been, or currently are, students with Dr. Higgins so seeing them interact with the organization in a new way has brought a new perspective to the Colts, as well as the classroom at Clarke. Working with Medical Associates, especially through the grant we received from them in 2014, has allowed us to really standardize and formalize a lot of what we do at the Colts, while also providing data and information to their doctors on this unique athletic and performing arts activity.”</p>

		</div>
	</div>
    
    			<p><i>January 17, 2019</i></p>
                
                <p>The Colts are set to host their January camp beginning Friday at the Five Flags Center in downtown Dubuque. There is some snow moving through the midwest on Friday, so please make the best decision for you depending on your path of travel. Your membership status in the drum corps will not be affected if you are unable to attend camp due to travel concerns. We have a large number of flights coming in so we will continue to have camp for those that have the ability to make the trip.</p>
                <p>If you arrive in Dubuque earlier than 5:00 p.m. on Friday, you are free to stop at the Colts Warehouse, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colts+Youth+Organization/@42.4611249,-90.678487,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87e32b9b69fe772b:0x9f6fdf53bcf28f4e!8m2!3d42.461121!4d-90.676293" target="_blank">2300 Twin Valley Dr., Dubuque, IA 52003</a>. If you need to be dropped off at any point during the day, we will make sure you have transportation to Five Flags before the start of camp. If you would need to arrive before 9:00 a.m. on Friday, please contact Jason Schubert, Director of Operations and Media, at <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a> or <a href="tel:6306667489">630.666.7489</a> or Vicki MacFarlane, Colts Director, at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or <a href="tel:5635649016">563.564.9016</a>.</p>
                <p>Dubuque is in the path to receive anywhere from 1 - 5 inches of snow on Friday late afternoon and evening depending on which weather service you turn to for information. The snow is said to be of the light, fluffy variety and winds could cause some drifting in areas. The outlook for Sunday travel from Dubuque is much better, although temperatures are expected to fall into the single digits. Please take the usual precautions for driving in winter weather by packing some extra food, water, and blankets in your vehicle. We will have plenty of jumper cables available if your car has trouble starting on Sunday. Please bring a hat and gloves, as frigid temperatures are anticipated about the time loading starts on Sunday afternoon — especially if you are in the pit. We will have extra gloves on site as well.</p>
                <p>If you are scheduled to come to camp and and will be arriving late or have to cancel because of the weather, or for any other reason, please notify Jason Schubert, Director of Operations and Media, or Vicki MacFarlane, Colts Director, that your plans have changed. <a href="/about-contact">Click here to view the full list of contact information</a>. Thank you!</p>
                <p>We’re looking forward to an exciting weekend and a lot of growth for the drum corps!</p>

Parking is also available behind the Holiday Inn, as well as in the Five Flags Center Ramp on the corner of 4th and Iowa Streets.

                <br>
                <p><b>CAMP PAPERWORK</b><br>
                Prior to camp, you will be expected to turn in:<br>
                <ul>
					<li><a href="/rsvp" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. Regardless of your plans, submit an RSVP so we can keep you up to date. Be sure to include all necessary flight and travel information in the RSVP. If you need a ride from the airport, you will be notified by the Thursday immediately before the camp who will be picking you up. The RSVP should be submitted each month by interested students.</li>
					<li><a href="/memberapp" target="_blank">Member Application</a>. Submit your application in advance to save time at check in. All auditioning students <b>must</b> submit a member application. The application only needs to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes</li>
                    <li>Email a headshot of yourself to <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last), section, and which audition camp you are attending. This picture is added to your audition file so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. This picture must be submitted before the camp starts and is required of all attending. Make sure the image is clear, well lit, and contains your whole face. And, as great as your sunglasses or Snapchat filters may look, they don't belong in your headshot.</li>
				</ul>
                When you arrive to check in on Friday, bring with you:<br>
                <ul>
                	<li><a href="/documents/MedicalForm2019.pdf" target="_blank">Colts Medical History Form</a>. This form is <b>required</b> in order to audition. The medical form also provides permission to participate in our activities. Students 18 or older may sign their own medical form. Any student 17 or younger must have a parent or guardian signature to participate. Medical forms only need to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes. Be sure to complete both sides!</li>
                </ul>
                <b>If this is your second or more camp, you do not need to submit an application, medical history form, or headshot (unless your information has changed!). However, you will still need to submit an <a href="/rsvp" target="_blank">RSVP</a> for this camp.</b></p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Students stay overnight in the arena on the floor, as you will all summer. Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans), and tennis shoes (no high tops). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the weekend. <b>Don't forget to bring a water bottle!</b><br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you have absolutely no access to an instrument and need one provided, contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest. You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude, or excerpt you feel comfortable with. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group<br>
                <br>
                Percussion: Bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad. Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest. Cymbal should prepare a short phrase of your own choice musically and visually, in addition to the cymbal packet. Front ensemble students are expected to perform a short segment of a personal selection for the individual audition. We ask that you provide your own marching cymbals, sticks, and/or mallets, as well as a practice pad. We will provide all other instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
Positions are available in all sections. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly. Recall auditions can be scheduled three weeks after your initial audition at one of our events. Attend early and attend often for your best chance at a position in the Colts.</p>
				<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
                <p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else. You can pay your fees by cash or check, or by card online at the <a href="http://store.colts.org/Summer-Fees_c_29.html" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="/rsvp">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 p.m. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend. If you arrive at a random time throughout the weekend, the kitchen or check in table are great places to start with questions anytime you visit about where you can help.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
		<br>
		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work or construction projects at the corps warehouse. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand!<br>
        <br>
