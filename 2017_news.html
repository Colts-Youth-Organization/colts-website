                <p><i>December 22, 2017</i></p>
                <p>When the <a href="http://dradubuque.com" target="_blank">Dubuque Racing Association</a> announced their grant awards to local nonprofit
organizations this year, the Colts Youth Organization was pleased to learn it received $15,000
for the purchase of a newer 15-passenger van to support the Colts summer tour. This was the
21st consecutive year that the Colts received a grant from the DRA. The Dubuque Racing
Association (DRA) is the nonprofit license holder for Q Casino and Diamond Jo Casino. Grants
have been offered to area nonprofit organizations through a competitive submission process
since 1985.</p>
				<p>Last year, a grant for a new box trailer transformed the way the Colt Cadets parents and
volunteers were able to prepare, cook, and serve the drum corps throughout the summer. In total,
the Colt Cadets volunteers prepare an average of 400 meals per day during their 45-day tour.
During the winter, the trailer is used by the Colts to transport food and cooking supplies to winter
audition camps.</p>
				<p>In the past few years, the Colts received grants from the DRA that assisted with the purchase of a
custom tent for our souvenir marketplace, percussion equipment for the Colts Cadets, and new
uniforms for both corps in their 50th anniversary season in 2013.</p>		
				<p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $375,000 for new
instruments, uniforms, vehicles and trailers, computers, and building improvements.</p>
				<p>Thank you to the DRA for continuing to support the vision of the Colts Youth
Organization and our mission to "use music & excellence to teach other about
success in life."</p>
				<p>More information can be obtained by calling the Colts Office at <a href="tel:5635824872">563.582.4872</a>,

                Students stay overnight in the arena on the floor, as you will all summer. Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans), and tennis shoes (no high tops). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the weekend. If this is your second camp, do not forget to bring your audition t-shirt! Replacement t-shirts can be purchased at check-in for $10.00.<br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you do not have access to an instrument and will need one provided, contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>.

                <br>
                Percussion: Bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad. Prospective members should be familiar with the exercise packet that best fits your area of interest.

We will provide all instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
Positions are open in all sections of the corps. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year, or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly.</p>
				<p>If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>
                <p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else. You can pay your fees by cash or check, or by card online at the <a href="http://store-colts-org.3dcartstores.com/Summer-Fees_c_29.html" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a>.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming rehearsal, you must be in touch with <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> and your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 6:45 p.m. in a location to be announced. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here!<br>
		<br>
		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work or construction projects at the corps warehouse. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand!<br>
        <br>

                <p>Last week, the Colts Booster Club hosted the first annual <a href="masquerade.html" target="_blank">La Musique & Masqeruade Ball</a> at the Hotel Julien in downtown Dubuque. This was the first time the Colts Booster Club had hosted the event, and the first time a masquerade ball was hosted in Dubuque. Music was provided by the Ken Killian Swingtet and featured jazz, swing, and big band selections from the 1920's to now. Guests were able to dance, take pictures in a photo booth, enjoy delicious hors d'oeuvres, and bid on a number of silent auction baskets. The final amount of money fundraised is still being calculated, but should be available soon!</p>
                <p>Throughout the night, guests were able to vote for their favorite costumed attendee using their ticket stubs. There were many incredible costumes and masks at the event, but the final winner was Gail Hansen, who won with nearly 20 votes!</p>
                <p>Plans are already being made for the 2018 Masquerade Ball, and no doubt it will be another wonderful evening of fun, dancing, and fundraising. A huge <b>thank you!</b> to all who contributed to making this event a success, and a special thanks to title sponsor <b>Runde Auto Group</b>. Thank you for being a part of the inaugural Masquerade Ball!</p>
                <p>The Booster Club was formed on November 16, 1966, and it exists to support the programs of the Colts Youth Organization through local fundraising events, including the annual car wash and masquerade ball.

"From his innovative writing, to his ability to assemble a master faculty for our percussion program, to his high level teaching, we could not be more fortunate to have his leadership in our world of Colts percussion. It's an honor to work with Ben."

"The color guard has been a constant strength for the Colts over the years, and I'm very excited for the opportunity to continue building the legacy alongside Vicki, Howard, and the rest of the Colts educational staff and design team."</p>
                <p>"In the pursuit to find a leader to bring the Colts color guard to the next level of excellence, I made one telephone call, and that was to Jade Bouza," said Howard. "I have had the opportunity of working with Jade on other projects, and her level of expertise, professionalism, and talent is beyond reproach.

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Announce 2018 Drum Majors</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>August 23, 2017</i></p>
                <p>The Colts are proud to announce their drum majors for the 2018 season: Jack Riehl and Elijah Elmshaeuser.</p>
                <img src="img/jriehl.jpg" width="250" height="" alt="Jack Riehl" class="alignleft imageborder">
                <p>Jack Riehl began his drum corps career with the Colts in 2014 in the front ensemble and is entering his fifth season with the corps, having spent three years on marimba and vibe and this past season as drum major. Originally from Westerville, Ohio, Jack previously marched five seasons with his high school's marching band and indoor drum line. While at Westerville North High School, he spent three of the five seasons as percussion section leader. In the 2016 season of Winter Guard International (WGI) season, Jack was a member of the front ensemble of ConneXus Independent, an Independent Open Class finalist group based out of Delaware, Ohio.</p>
                <p>Currently, Jack is attending the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, where he is pursuing a degree in medical sciences. Outside of his studies, Jack is an active member of Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA), an international student organization focused on leadership and technical skill development in the medical and health fields through workshops, trainings, and competitive events. During the fall and winter seasons, he is a front ensemble instructor with the Milford High School band in Milford, Ohio. Following graduation, Jack plans to continue to medical school and become a pediatric surgeon.</p>
                <p>“This past season, I learned a lot about the role of being drum major and the discipline, teamwork, and communication it takes to be successful in the role. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to help me along the way. The way this group gels together from the top down is absolutely incredible and unlike any other group I have been a part of. I can’t wait to push all of this momentum into the 2018 season and lead the Red Team on a successful journey."</p>
                <img src="img/eelmshaeuser.jpg" width="250" height="" alt="Eljah Elmshaeuser" class="alignright imageborder">
                <p>Elijah Elmshaeuser is entering his second season with the Colts, having spent this past summer in the trumpet section. He currently attends the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, studying mechanical engineering. Following the completion of his degree, Elijah would like to work behind the scenes of movies designing sets and special effects. Outsde of school, Elijah is on the student leadership team of the Cornhusker Marching Band and is an active member of the Big Red Express.</p>
                <p>Elijah was born and raised in Ogallala, Nebraska, where he attended Ogallala High School. While there, he participated in band, choir, speech, drama, mock trial, and baseball, as well as several student organizations. In his free time, Elijah enjoys rock climbing, flying drones, playing intermural sports, and watching movies.</p>
                <p>"After one season with the Colts, I was blown away with the amount of growth in the organization. We have a great staff who cares passionately for its members and works hard to bring excellence to the corps. I am thrilled at the opportunity to become drum major and to work with an amazing staff. The Colts are headed in a great direction and I can’t wait for the 2018 season.”</p>
                <p>"The drum majors are truly the heartbeat of the organization, in so many ways, and having student leadership at the helm with as much talent, passion, and dedication as Jack and Elijah will be an incredible asset to the 2018 Colts," said Program Coordinator Howard Weinstein. "Not only will their strengths compliment each other, they each bring a unique ability to bring the very best out of their peers both on and off the field. I could not be more excited to work with these brilliant young leaders."</p>
                <p>"The structure of the leadership program that Howard has brought to the Colts has already allowed these two students to excel, and it will be wonderful to see them continue to shape the culture of the corps through their own actions and by guiding their peers," said Corps Director Vicki MacFarlane. "They both bring such passion, dedication, and selflessness to the table and are already great leaders by example. I am especially excited to work with Jack in his second year as he continues to apply the lessons learned and skills acquired from his first summer as drum major. These two students have incredible potential to refine what it means to be a Colt and live out that meaning in day to day life."

                <p><i>August 15, 2017</i></p>
                <p>The Colts and Colt Cadets concluded their 2017 seasons with performances at the Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis, August 10 - 12. The Colt Cadets finished 14th at the DCI Open Class Championships in Michigan City on Monday, and ended their season with a score of 60.925 Thursday morning in Lucas Oil Stadium. The Colts made a strong charge at the end of the season, being featured on their fifth consecutive "Big, Loud, and Live" brodcast on Thursday, August 10, and ended the season in 15th with a score of 83.888. Many throughout finals week commented on how the corps performance, and the corps program <i>"Both Sides Now,"</i> was the strongest they have seen from the Colts in many years.</p>

                <p>Both corps wrapped up their competitive seasons and dismissed from Ball State University on Saturday, August 12. The end of season wrap up for both corps included speeches from all caption heads, both corps directors, playing of the corps song, and, for Colts, speeches from its 25 age outs.</p>
                <p>The Colts media team was hard at work throughout the summer, documenting every move, rim shot, and catch on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dcicolts/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dcicolts/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. Be sure to check out the great pictures and videos!</p>
                <p>This summer brought many new and exciting things to the Colts, including new design and instructional staff, the corps first visit to the northeast since 2012, the corps first visit to Florida since 2008, and brand new uniforms. In total, the corps traveled over 12,000 miles this summer and did so with incredible smoothness and flexibility, thanks in large parts to strong partnerships with <a href="http://www.gowindstar.com" target="_blank">Windstar Lines</a> and <a href="http://www.hirschbach.com" target="_blank">Hirschbach</a> semi tractors. The new design and instructional staff brought many unique perspectives with them, which all meshed together incredibly well to create one of the most aesthetically pleasing and enthralling shows of the summer. The corps stops in the northeast included three parades around the Boston area - in total, the Colts performed for an estimated 100,000 people in one day. Moving quickly down the highway to the Sunshine State in just three nights, the Colts spent three days in Florida, performing twice, before heading back north to Dubuque for the annual home show, <b>Music On The March</b>.

                <p>The Colt Cadets also had many new and exiciting things for their 50th anniversary. First-year director David Alford did an incredible job of recruitment and brought together one of the largest groups Cadets has seen in their entire history. In total, there were 87 students this season. This increase in numbers allowed the design team, led by first-year program coordinator Phil Snyder, to challenge the members of the Cadets in new ways with show pacing, content, and overall design. The Cadets celebrated their 50th anniversary with a large crowd of alumni on Saturday, July 15, at Eagle Point Park in Dubuque. The event featured a cook out and a performance from the Colt Cadets. You can read more about the event <a href="2017_192.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 2017 also saw the induction of Sonia Hickson, founder and first director of the Colt Cadets, into the <a href="http://www.colts.org/people-hof.html" target="_blank">Colts Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
                <p><i>Photo courtesy of Brent Smith.</i></p>
                <p>The organization as a whole also had many successes throughout the summer. June and July featured three great events planned by the Alumni Steering Committee that brought together the alumni from both corps together to celebrate the season and reconnect with the current membership. August saw the recognition of Bill Symoniak as one of the DCI Volunteers of the Year. Construction at the warehouse has continued, and most of the office spaces are almost ready to be moved into! Plans are in place to finish a majority, if not all, of the remodel this winter. Finally, the Colts inducted six new individuals to the Colts Hall Of Fame.

                <p>Of course, this season, and this activity, could not have happened without the help, dedication, passion, and love from our many parents and volunteers. A huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to anyone and everyone who helped throughout the summer, whether cooking, driving, sewing uniforms, or anything else that helps both drum corps move down the road, the Colts appreciate you so much and cannot thank you enough. Similarly, a huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to all of the incredible donors, sponsors, and endorsers who continue to believe in the mission of the Colts Youth Organization.</p> 
                <p>Plans are already being formulated by the Alumhi Steering Committee to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the Colts next summer.

                <p><i>July 17, 2017</i></p>
				
				<p>On Saturday, July 15, Colts alumni and the Colt Cadets, along with their families and friends, gathered at Eagle Point Park in Dubuque to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Colt Cadets. The night prior, the Colt Cadets had performed in the annual Colts home show, Music On The March, finishing with a season high of 51.100. The alumni presence at the home show was strong, as just before was the first annual Colts Alumni Tailgate, organized by the Alumni Steering Committee.</p>
                <p>The weather for Saturday could not have been more perfect for the event. There was an incredible turn out from the alumni, spanning all 50 years of the Colt Cadets. A generous alumnni donated the meal of burgers and hot dogs, with the Colt Cadets providing plates and utensils. The hightlight of the afternoon was the stand still performance given by the Colt Cadets of their 2017 program, <a href="http://www.colts.org/2017_185.html" target="_blank">"The River's Edge"</a>. The event was a great opportunity for the alumni to reconnect with the current membership of the Colt Cadets and to share stories and memories from their time marching. A huge thanks to all who attended and who helped make this day possible!</p>

		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>June 30, 2017</i></p>
				
				<p>The Colts Youth Organization will host its annual awards and recognition banquet for the Colt and Colt Cadets on Wednesday, August 9th, at <a href="http://www.delawarecountyfair.net/facility-rentals" target="_blank">Heartland Hall</a> on the grounds of the Delaware County Fairgrounds in Muncie, Indiana. You can view a map of the facility <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Delaware+County+Fairgrounds/@40.2058859,-85.4020464,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x229d08dfd74067a5!8m2!3d40.206142!4d-85.392102" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>The annual banquet has traditionally been held in Dubuque on Thanksgiving weekend, but in recent years it's been more difficult for many members to attend. Last year, the Colts began hosting the annual banquet during finals week, allowing every member of both drum corps to attend. The banquet allows the Colts to recognize the season's achievements, as well as the outstanding contributions of both members and volunteers.</p>
                <p>Details for the evening are still being finalized but we plan to begin the evening around 6:30 PM with some social time and mingling before we get into the member awards and acknowledgements.</p>
                <p>In order to prepare for the evening, the Colts are asking for an RSVP. You can RSVP by using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoH9T1-PqgnF_dQUbffVuUk5CX-09ofAdEOr-6O2oO3wIiNw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">this form</a>.
                <p>It's hard to believe Finals Week is almost here! Thank you all for an incredible summer so far!</p>

                <p>While all these times do remain subject to change, below are the details for the Colts Car Wash and move in schedule for Colt Cadets.</p>
                <p>Parents and students from out-of-town coming into Dubuque further than two hours away are able to check in to Thomas Jefferson Middle School starting at 8:00 PM on Friday, June 9. Personal vehicles MUST be parked in the front lot across from the front entrance to the school at the corner of Merz and Althauser. Please note that this is not the typical parking lot used for rehearsals at Jefferson. A light snack will be set out that evening, and lights out will be at 11:15 PM. Students will sleep in the wrestling room and parents can stay in a separate classroom. The Colts will arrive likely around 12:30 AM on Saturday, June 10, with members sleeping in both the main and second gym.</p>
                <p>Wake up for all Colts and the Colt Cadets at Jefferson will be at 7:15 AM on Saturday, June 10. Those staying at Jefferson will eat breakfast and pack a sack lunch for the day with the Colts off their kitchen truck. All luggage and equipment brought in for Colt Cadets must be fully packed up and put off to the side in the wrestling room. Between 7:45 and 8:15 AM, any Colt Cadets students may drop off their luggage in the wrestling room and should only use the door directly into the wrestling room near the corner of Merz and Althauser. All Colt Cadets students should be picked up or arrange their own rides to their car wash sites by 8:15 AM and should arrive to their sites by 9:00 AM. Car wash is from 9:00am to 4:00pm. Local students should bring their own sack lunch, and students should stagger their 30 minute lunch breaks in the middle of the day. It is very important to wear sunscreen, especially on your feet! Also, be sure to drink lots of water to hydrate for the intense heat this weekend.</p>
                <p>After 4:00 PM, Colt Cadets students may be picked up through rides arranged by themselves or their parents and brought to Thomas Jefferson Middle School. A joint pizza party will be held with the Colts and Colt Cadets, sponsored by a generous parent of a Colt Cadet, starting at 4:30 PM until 5:15 PM. While Colts will be “EPL’ing” to check out from the school, Colt Cadets will begin check in at 4:30 PM. Unloading of equipment will begin at 5:45 PM, after the Colts have departed. There will be a full member and parent meeting in the main gym at 6:15 PM. <b>Welcome to the 2017 Colt Cadets!</b>

		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>June 7, 2017</i></p>
    <p>The 240 members of the Colts and Colt Cadets will be practicing more than music on Saturday, June 10th, as they instead become experts at washing cars! Twenty simultaneous locations will be staffed with members of both corps from 9:00AM to 4:00PM for the annual Colts Car Wash fundraiser. Since the inception of this program in 1985, over $350,000 has been raised for summer travel expenses of the Colts and Colt Cadets.</p>
    <p>Last year, the groups washed nearly 800 cars and earned over $40,000 in donations and paid pledges. Proceeds from the car wash will be used for summer tour costs. Increased prices for diesel and food will be a real challenge this summer, and the car wash helps get the two groups down the road.</p>
    <p>The car wash is free, with donations accepted. There is no minimum donation expected. The weather looks to be a great day for a car wash - sunny and a high of 85 - so be sure to stop at one of the many locations around Dubuque!</p>
    <p>The Colts would like to extend a big <b>THANK YOU</b> to our host sites! The car wash would not be successful without the warm welcome we receive from these businesses.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>May 30, 2017</i></p>
    <p>After several months of anticipation, the Colts debuted their new uniforms to the world at the annual Memorial Day Parade in downtown Dubuque. The uniforms were created by world-renowned uniform designer <a href="http://www.fjminc.com/cesario-drumcorps#tab1" target="_blank">Michael Cesario</a> and printed by Fred J. Miller, Inc. Cesario has long been a designer of uniforms for the corps, starting in 1986 where he pioneered the triangle concept found in many modern uniforms, which featured the lighter colors on top and a fade to the darker colors.</p>
    <p>These new uniforms could not have happened without generous donations from friends, fans, family, and alumni. <b>THANK YOU!</b> for helping make these uniforms a reality! The uniforms could not have happened without you.</p>
    <p>If you missed the Memorial Day Parade, you can also see the new uniform "in action" at one of our many performances around the country this summer. <a href="http://colts.org/schedule-colts.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view our full summer schedule!</p>

    <p>Inspired by life high above the Mississippi River, and marking their 50th anniversary, the Colt Cadets are proud to present their 2017 production, "The River's Edge." This season, the Colt Cadets will bring audiences through various scenes along the river, soaring high above the valleys, sailing through the currents, and even enjoying life in a river town. Highlighted by Smetana's <i>Vltava</i> (<i>Die Moldau</i>), the Colt Cadets depict a great river traveling through woods, bluffs, meadows, and stunning landscapes.</p>
    <p>The Colt Cadets will debut their 2017 production, along with the Colts, at the 7th Annual <a href="http://colts.org/summerpremiere.html" target="_blank">Colts Summer Premiere</a> on Friday, June 23 at the Loras College Rock Bowl Stadium. The competitive season begins on June 24 in Whitewater, Wisconsin, and concludes August 7 - 8 at the Drum Corps International Open Class Championships in Michigan City, Indiana.</p>

</uL></p>

<br>

<p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
Students stay overnight in the gym on the floor, as you will all summer. Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans please), and tennis shoes (no high tops, please). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Please bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. Please remember to bring a white t-shirt for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p>
<br>
<p>Brass: Please bring a binder for music, and gloves. Instruments will be provided for the weekend.</p>
<p>Color Guard: Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), black pants or shorts and a black shirt for Sunday's performance, your own rifle and/or sabre (if you can), and knee pads (if you like). There is no need to purchase any special equipment for rehearsals. You will wear your audition t-shirt for most rehearsal segments through the weekend.</p>
<p>Percussion: Please bring your own sticks or mallets, practice pad, and a binder for music. We will provide all instruments for camps. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group. Please wear the audition t-shirt for the Sunday afternoon performance.</p>
<br>

<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a location to be announced. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend.</p>

<p>Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colt Cadets successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colt Cadets experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.</p>

<p>Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.</p>

<p>Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/iowa/hampton-inn-dubuque-DBQIAHX/index.html" target="_blank">Hampton Inn</a> here in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a> and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.</p>

<p>Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="http://www.colts.org/signupform.html" target="_blank">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.</p>

<p>All parents and volunteers are Colts Boosters! Plan on joining us Saturday morning, before or after breakfast (approximately 8:30 am), to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places to start with questions about where you can help.</p>

<br>

<p><b>SUMMER CHECK IN</b><br>
Check in for the summer will be on Saturday, June 10, in conjunction with our annual car wash fundraiser. Full details are still being sorted out and will be announced following the May camp. We ask that parents will help by signing up to supervise a car wash location and help provide transportation of students to their car wash locations to begin at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>To arrange alternate plans, please notify us by email at <a href="mailto:david@colts.org">david@colts.org</a> or call <a href="tel:5635824872">563.582.4872</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="http://colts.org/rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a>.</p>

<br>

<p><b>AUGUST AIRLINE PLANS</b><br>
<p>For those who will be flying home after finals, please note: You should purchase a plane ticket home no earlier than 6:00 AM on Sunday, August 13, from the Indianapolis Airport (IND). We will run a bus from the stadium to the Indianapolis Airport after finals early Sunday morning. A fun-filled overnight at the airport awaits you with about 2,000 other corps members!</p>

<br>

<p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br>
These parts have been added to your bill and will be emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out after Car Wash. Each brass and battery member receives a plume, member shirt, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals/DM also receive gloves). Prices for Brass/Percussion/DM will be $50. Guard members pay $75 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, under uniform garments and other necessary personal items.</p>

<br>

<p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 10, 2017</b><br>
This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have close to 30. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible! You can access the pledge sheet and instructions on the <a href="http://colts.org/documents.html" target="_blank">Member Documents</a> page.</p>
</p>
<p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership agreement. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 10 from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $45,000 in our one-day event!</p>
<p>Please plan, so that you can do your share. It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones.</p>
<p>The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p>
<p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge of a penny per car total will end up being around $8. If we wash 750 cars across approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received for you. We then collect these payments through the office by mail. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.
<p>We ask that parents will help by signing up to supervise a car wash location and help provide transportation of students to their car wash locations to begin at 9:00 AM.</p>

<br>

<p><b>SUMMER TOUR HELP!</b><br>

<br>

<p><b>DCI WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS HOTEL & TICKETS</b><br>
    Finals Week is August 10 - 12 in Indinapolis, Indiana. There are still great seats and great rooms available for the best week of the summer!

    <p>The Colt Cadets have their prelims and finals in Michigan City on Monday and Tuesday and will also be performing in prelims on Thursday in Lucas Oil Stadium. The top 15 corps at Thursday prelims will be shown live at Star Cinema theaters throughout the country beginning at 5:00 pm. Go to www.dci.org to find the location nearest you. If you can't make it to Indianapolis, this is the next best thing!</p>

    <p>"They say... logic makes you think... and emotion makes you act..."</p>
    
    <p>The phyiscal construction of the human brain is very defined:</p>
    <uL>
    	<li>The left side is where all things analytical are derived. Linear. Strategic and categorical. Always in control. Formulas and absolutes. There is no gray area; it's all black and white.</li>
    	<li>The right side is where all things creative are discovered. Movement, passion and emotions. Free spirit, imagination and the feeling of wind beneath your wings. Colors and shades envelope the senses and thoughts.</li>
    </uL>
    <p>In reality, the mind does not divide itself in two quite so perfectly. It takes two halves to make the whole, working together to create a complete mind. The duality of the human brain allows us to experience logic and emotion so deeply and simultaneously. There is no doubt that it takes both sides to make us who we are.</p>
    
    <p>The Colts are proud to announce their 2017 program....</p>

    <p>Local students with schools still in session during Spring Training are asked to attend evening and weekend portions of rehearsal so you don't fall behind. <b>Attendance and communication is critical</b>.</p>

    <p><b>CAR PARKING OVER SUMMER</b><br>
    If you are driving your car, you will park it for the weekend at Roosevelt, and then take it to the corps hall prior to us leaving the school Monday morning for the parade. Your car will be kept throughout the summer at our vehicle lot at the corps hall. The lot is not secured. We prefer that you do not leave a car in Dubuque for the summer. If you have no other alternative, please contact <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">Jason</a> in advance of the weekend. Please only leave your car in Dubuque if absolutely essential. <i>Although we do our best to keep everything safe, the Colts accept no responsibility for cars left in Dubuque</i>.</p>
    <br>
	<p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br>
		These parts have been added to your bill and will be emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out at the Memorial Day camp. Each brass and battery member receives a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals/DM also purchase gloves). Prices for Brass/Cymbals/DM will be $100; Battery $80 (no gloves); Front Ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $150 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag, and other necessary personal items.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 10, 2017</b><br>
		This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>
	<p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 10.</p>
	<p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $45,000 in our one-day event! It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas, and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones. The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p>
	<p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge will end up being around $7.50. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received. We collect these payments through the office by mail or online. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5.00. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p>
	<br>
    <p><b>DCI WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS HOTEL & TICKETS</b><br>
    Finals Week is August 10 - 12 in Indinapolis, Indiana. There are still great seats and great rooms available for the best week of the summer! Please note that the Colts WILL perform August 10 and 11, but are not guaranteed a spot in finals on August 12. Plan accordingly. We have seats available for all three shows. You can purchase your tickets online at the <a href="http://store-colts-org.3dcartstores.com/DCI-World-Championships_c_40.html" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a>. If you need assistance, you can contact the Colts Office at <a href="mailto:office@colts.org">office@colts.org</a>.</p>
    <p>The Colt Cadets have their prelims and finals in Michigan City on Monday and Tuesday and will also be performing in prelims on Thursday in Lucas Oil Stadium. The top 15 corps at Thursday prelims will be shown live at Star Cinema theaters throughout the country beginning at 5:00 pm. Go to www.dci.org to find the location nearest you. If you can't make it to Indianapolis, this is the next best thing!</p>

                <p><i>April 26, 2017</i></p>
				
				<p>In preparation for the Colts 55th anniversary in 2018, the Colts Alumni Steering Committee has been meeting monthly to establish an alumni network for the corps. The committee is composed of members from every generation of the corps, stretching through the years as Junior Dukes, Legion-Aires, Colt .45, and finally as the Colts. The main goals are to establish a strong alumni network that allows alumni to engage with each other and for alumni to engage with the current corps membership. A new tradition began this winter, with various alumni speaking to the members at their camps. The alumni include Dave Lang (baritone, 1977 - 1985), Scott Weber (soprano, 1989 - 1993), and Britt (Panuska) Cromwell (baritone, 2004 - 2007). For the April camp, Steve Delaney (more commonly known as "Slim"), cymbal and timpani player from 1973 - 1982, will be speaking to the corps.</p>
                <p>For the summer, there are several events planned for the alumni to reconnect, and to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Colt Cadets. On Friday, June 23, the Colts will be hosting its seventh annual <a href="http://colts.org/summerpremiere.html" target="_blank">Summer Premiere</a> at Loras College. This free performance will be the first time the Colts and Colt Cadets will present their full competitive shows for the 2017 season. Immediately following, there will be an alumni get-together at the new Colts building, located at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/2300+Twin+Valley+Dr,+Dubuque,+IA+52003/@42.4611251,-90.6784869,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87e32952a306d667:0xb8304dc54e7c3f17!8m2!3d42.4611212!4d-90.6762929" target="_blank">2300 Twin Valley Drive</a>. This event will be bring-your-own refreshments, "potluck" style, and will include a tour of the new facility.</p>
                <p>On Friday, July 14, the Colts will host its annual home show, <a href="http://colts.org/dalzell_dbq.html" target="_blank">Music On The March</a>, at Dalzell Field on the campus of Dubuque Senior High School. The show begins at 7:00 PM, but starting at 5:00 PM there will be an alumni tailgate just down the street from the high school at St. Anthony's Catholic Church. This event is being sponsored by several generous alumni, but donations will be accepted throughout the evening to benefit the corps. After the home show, alumni can return to Champps's Americana restaurant for a late-night hang out. A block of rooms is also set as at the <a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/iowa/hampton-inn-dubuque-DBQIAHX/index.html" target="_blank">Hampton Inn Dubuque</a> for the nights of July 14 and 15.</p>
                <p>The next morning, on Saturday, July 15, the Colt Cadets will present a stand-still performance of their 2017 competitive show at Eagle Point Park in Dubuque. The concert will begin at 11:00 AM, with a picnic to follow. Alumni are encouraged to attend and celebrate the Colt Cadets current season, as well as their 50th anniversary. The Colts will be able to provide plates, napkins, cutlery, and a grill, but alumni are asked to bring their own dish to share. The picnic will conclude by 3:00 PM.</p>
                <p>More information and specifics will be posted closer to the events on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColtsAlumni" target="_blank">Colts Alumni Facebook Page</a>. Be sure to "like" the page, and encourage alumni who marched with you to do the same. Thank you for all your support of this great organization as the Colts head into their 54th season!</p>

	<p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
		We provide ground transportation anytime to and from the Dubuque Regional Airport (DBQ) for Dubuque camps. We can also accommodate flights into surrounding airports (Quad Cities, Madison, Rockford, or Cedar Rapids). <b>You MUST notify the office prior to booking a flight into anywhere other than Dubuque.</b> MLI (Moline) and CID (Cedar Rapids) are very close to Dubuque and reasonable in fare. ORD (O'Hare) travel MUST land prior to 3:30 pm on Friday and depart no earlier than 7:30 pm on Sunday. MDW (Midway) travel MUST land prior to 2:30 pm on Friday and depart no earlier than 8:30 pm on Sunday. If you plan on using either of these airports, please let <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> know prior to booking flights.<br>
		<br>
		If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call <a href="tel:5635824872">563.582.4872</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. All flight details should also be listed on your RSVP.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
		There are positions available in the brass line and color guard. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year.<br>
		<br>
		If this is your second or third rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.<br>
		<br>
		Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
		Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
		<br>
		If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
		An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a location to be announced. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
		<br>
		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href="http://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="blank" >Hampton Inn</a> here in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a> and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="http://www.colts.org/signupform.html" target="blank">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.<br>
		<br>
		All parents and volunteers are Colts Boosters! Plan on joining us Saturday morning, before or after breakfast (approximately 8:30 am), to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places to start with questions about where you can help.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>SOUVENIR SALES</b><br>
		Throughout the weekend, all items in the <a href="http://store-colts-org.3dcartstores.com" target="_blank">Colts Mall</a> will be available for sale! Summer is coming up soon, and the weekend will be a great time to purchase a present for your special someone! Anyone is able to purchase souvenirs - students, parents, friends, family, etc. The souvenir racks will be set up by the check in table, and you can purchase your items there.</p>
		<br>
		
	<p><b>EARLY MOVE-IN FOR GUARD AND PERCUSSION</b><br>
		We will be staying at the Dubuque Armory again this season, and bussing to fields. Please plan on arriving at 6:00 pm on Sunday evening May 21, so we may begin rehearsal bright and early Monday morning, May 22.</p>
	<p>If your parents are able to volunteer for a day or two during this time, we would be VERY EXCITED to have them with us! Please have them contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">Vicki</a> to help during this time.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>MAY \ SPRING TRAINING \ AUGUST AIRLINE PLANS</b><br>
		We can pick you up at the airport or bus station in Dubuque. If you need assistance getting here from another airport, please call us before booking flights. Rides from other local airports such as Moline (MLI) or Cedar Rapids (CID) can generally be accommodated.</p>
	<p>To arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call <a href="tel:5635824872">563.582.4872</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a>.</p>
	<p>For those who will be flying home after finals, please note: You should purchase a plane ticket home no earlier than 6:00 am on Sunday, August 13, from the Indianapolis Airport (IND). We will run a bus from the stadium to the Indianapolis Airport after finals early Sunday morning. A fun-filled overnight at the airport awaits you with about 2,000 other corps members!</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br>
		These parts have been added to your bill and will be emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out at the Memorial Day camp. Each brass and battery member receive a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals/DM also purchase gloves). Prices for Brass/Cymbals/DM will be $100; Battery $80 (no gloves); Front Ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $150 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag and other necessary personal items.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 10, 2017</b><br>
		This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>
	<p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 10.</p>
	<p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $45,000 in our one-day event!</p>
	<p>Please plan, so that you can do your share. It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones.</p>
	<p>The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel. It's extra important that we do well this year with what is happening in the world and with beef prices going crazy.</p>
	<p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge of a penny per car total will end up being around $8. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received for you. We then collect these payments through the office by mail. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p>

                <p><i>April 15, 2017</i></p>
                
	<p>The Colts are now accepting nominations for their Hall of Fame class of 2017! Any member of the public may nominate an individual for induction into the Colts Hall of Fame by submitting a letter describing the reasons their nominee should be considered, along with a brief description of the role and history of contributions that person has made to the Colts organization. <a href="documents/HOF_Nomination.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a description of the nomination process.</p>
	<p>The Hall of Fame was established in 1993 during the 30th anniversary celebration of the Colts. The award is the highest level of recognition given by the organization, and many of the founders of the Colts were the first to be inducted. The Hall of Fame went dormant following our 40th anniversary but was reintroduced in 2015 to honor those who have provided distinguished service to the organization. Throughout the years, the Colts have recognized board members, alumni, volunteers, and staff as Hall of Fame inductees.</p>
	<p>In the days ahead, we will expand the recognition of the individuals currently included in the Hall of Fame by adding a brief biography and photograph for each. If you have photographs, anecdotes, or other information to add to Hall of Fame member biographies, please send them to: <a href="mailto:hof@colts.org">hof@colts.org</a>. You can view a full listing of all Colts Hall of Fame members <a href="people-hof.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Act now, as 2017 nominations are due by May 22!</p>

	<p><b>Learn More About The Colt Cadets:</b></p>

<p>Summer membership in the Colt Cadets is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no audition to be a member, but students are expected to be strong team players with a desire to be great!</p>

<p>Our preseason rehearsals are approached as clinics, so that any young person can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to experience a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best. </p>

<p>During the summer the Colt Cadets will perform for more than 75,000 people in seven states. In 2016, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Last season marked the sixth consecutive year the Colt Cadets placed as DCI Open Class Finalists. For the full summer schedule, <a href="schedule-cadets.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p>We can make a variety of summer schedules work! Many members are able to participate in other summer activities while performing with the Colt Cadets. If you have questions about your specific summer plans, do not hesitate to call or email, and feel free to bring your summer schedule to an open rehearsal. Our staff will provide more insight on how to balance your summer plans.</p>

<p>All instruments, uniforms, and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of their summer membership fees. But remember, all preseason rehearsals are FREE to attend. </p>

<p>Anyone unavailable for this event can still join us at one of our upcoming rehearsals in Dubuque. See a full list of our preseason rehearsals <a href="schedule-preseason-cadets.html" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

		<br>
	<p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
		We provide ground transportation anytime to and from the Dubuque Regional Airport (DBQ) for Dubuque camps. We can also accommodate flights into surrounding airports (Quad Cities, Madison, Rockford, or Cedar Rapids). <b>You MUST notify the office prior to booking a flight into anywhere other than Dubuque.</b> MLI (Moline) and CID (Cedar Rapids) are very close to Dubuque and reasonable in fare. ORD (O'Hare) travel MUST land prior to 3:30 pm on Friday and depart no earlier than 7:30 pm on Sunday. MDW (Midway) travel MUST land prior to 2:30 pm on Friday and depart no earlier than 8:30 pm on Sunday. If you plan on using either of these airports, please let <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> know prior to booking flights.<br>
		<br>
		If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call <a href="tel:5635824872">563.582.4872</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. All flight details should also be listed on your RSVP.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
		There are positions available in every section of the brass line. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.<br>
		<br>
		If this is your second or third rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.<br>
		<br>
		Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
		Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="rsvp.php" target="_blank">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
		<br>
		If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
		<br>
	<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
		An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a location to be announced. Detailed schedules with the location will be at the check-in table. Bring all of your questions!<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
		<br>
		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href="http://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="blank" >Hampton Inn</a> here in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a> and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="http://www.colts.org/signupform.html" target="blank">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.<br>
		<br>
		All parents and volunteers are Colts Boosters! Plan on joining us Saturday morning, before or after breakfast (approximately 9 am), to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places to start with questions about where you can help.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>February 18, 2017</i></p>
    <img src="img/website_1.png" height="125" width="225" alt="Website Design 1" class="alignleft imageborder">
	<p>It began as a school project in the fall of 1998 in an introduction to web design course. Katherine Eichhorn was a Colts member and mellophone player who began marching in the Colt Cadets in 1994 and moved up to the Colts in 1997 before aging out in 2002. This initial version of the Colts website (pictured left) looks simple now, but when it was designed was considered ahead of its time for the drum corps activity. Katherine's father and board member, Randy Eichhorn, purchased the domain name colts.org for the project and allowed the corps to use it.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<img src="img/website_2.png" height="125" width="225" alt="Website Design 2" class="alignright imageborder">
	<p>As the Internet age continued to expand and become more prevalent around the world, the corps website was updated again (pictured right). However, the capabilities of the Internet were still developing - all forms had to be printed off and mailed or faxed in. While it's not that exciting today, having a fax machine in the early 2000's was still a big deal. This version debuted in 2002, again designed by Katherine as she completed her MIS degree at Iowa State University. Katherine is currently a product and solutions specialist at tickets.com in New York City.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
    <img src="img/website_3.png" height="125" width="225" alt="Website Design 2" class="alignleft imageborder">
	<p>Throughout this time, Katherine was the only one who was able to update the website - all changes had to be sent to her before they could be uploaded. Around 2002, the ability to post news articles on the website was added, allowing the office staff to post directly to the website. With this change came another redesign of the website, which has been the website used since (pictured left). The design was a collaborative effort between several designers and creators, including Katherine and Jeff MacFarlane. This website redesign provided a major face-lift for the corps, allowing far more options for design and the amount of information that could be posted.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>During the Colts 50th anniversary season in 2013, discussions began again about redesigning the Colts website and alumnus Brandon Rogers was engaged to design the framework for the new website. Brandon Rogers was a trumpet and mellophone player starting in 2004 and aging out in 2007. Brandon currently works as a web developer with CloudCraze, a Chicago based company that develops web-based storefronts designed to engage and collaborate with Salesforce. The creation of the website framework was completed in 2015, allowing the office staff to take over and begin transferring all data and files from the old website to the new.</p>
	<p>A huge thank you to all who have been a part of the Colts' various websites throughout our time as an organization, but especially to Katherine and Brandon. Without their dedication, creativity and passion, the organization's presence online would not be what it is today.</p>

All flight details should also be listed on your RSVP.</p>

	<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
		There are positions available in every section of the brass line. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.<br>
		<br>
		If this is your second or third rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.<br>
		<br>
		Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>

	<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
		Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="rsvp.cfm" target="blank">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
		<br>
		If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
		
	<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
		An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a location to be announced at check in. Detailed schedules with the location will be at the check-in table. Bring all of your questions!<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
		<br>
		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href="http://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="blank" >Hampton Inn</a> here in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at (563)-690-2005 and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="http://www.colts.org/signupform.html" target="blank">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.<br>
		<br>
		All parents and volunteers are Colts Boosters! Plan on joining us Saturday morning, before or after breakfast (approximately 9 am), to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places to start with questions about where you can help.</p>
		
	<p><b>SOUVENIR SALES</b><br>
		Throughout the weekend, all items in the <a href="http://store-colts-org.3dcartstores.com" target="blank">Colts Mall</a> will be available for sale!

                <p><i>January 17, 2017</i></p>
                <p>The Colt Cadets will kick off the 2017 season with the first open rehearsal on February 12 from 1:00 to 5:00 pm at Table Mound Elementary in Dubuque. This preseason event is <b>FREE</b> to attend! Students are encouraged to arrive at 12:30 pm to sign in, meet new faces and help set up equipment. Come experience drum corps, bring a friend and see if the Colt Cadets is the place for <i>you!</i></p>
                <p>Colt Cadets winter rehearsals will continue February 26 and March 5 at Table Mound Elementary. This school is new for the Colt Cadets, but will be a great facility for the corps to use! An added benefit is the close proximity of the school to our new offices and warehouse building - just up the street!</p>
                <p>The first overnight camp will be the weekend of March 10 - 12 at Edgewood-Colesburg Jr. Sr. High. The camp will start at 7:00 p.m. Friday and finish 2:00 p.m. Sunday. This weekend camp will cost $25 to cover food and housing.</p>
                <p>Colt Cadets will continue March 26 and April 2 and 9. The battery will join the Colts for an overnight camp April 28 - 30. Final Spring rehearsals are set for May 7 and the weekend of May 19 - 21 for another overnight camp.</p>
                <p>For a full schedule for 2017, including spring rehearsals and summer, you can click <a href="schedule-cadets.html" target="blank">HERE</a>.

To print a poster for the 2017 Colt Cadets to hang in your room, on your fridge, or in your band room, you can click <a href="documents/cadets_poster_17.pdf" target="blank">HERE</a>.</p>
                <p>Help save time at check in! Fill out an <a href="memberapp.php" target="blank">ONLINE APPLICATION</a> and print your <a href="documents/cadets_permission.pdf" target="blank">PARENT CONSENT FORM</a> ahead of time. All students under the age of 18 must turn in a signed parent consent form to participate.</p>
                <p>All 2017 preseason rehearsals will take place at a school in the Dubuque area. Most Colt Cadets rehearsals are on Sunday afternoon, with the exception of two overnight camps for the full corps and one additional overnight camp for the battery. Those who might need transportation for rehearsals should contact David Alford, Colt Cadets Director, at <a href="mailto:david@colts.org">david@colts.org</a> to set up travel arrangements.</p>
                <p>Membership in the Colt Cadets is open to any young person in middle school or high school, with or without prior performance experience. There is no formal audition to be a member, but students are expected to be strong team players with a desire to be great!</p>
                <p>These rehearsals are approached as clinics, so any young person can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to experience a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best.</p>
                <p>During the summer, the Colt Cadets will perform about 25 times this summer between mid-June and mid-August, and will perform for more than 75,000 people across the Midwest. In 2017, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships. The Colt Cadets have also made consistent appearances in Open Class finals in Michigan City, Indiana throughout the past decade.</p>
                <p>All instruments, uniforms and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of their summer membership fees.</p>
                <p>To learn more about the Colt Cadets, you can click <a href="program-cadets.html" target="blank">HERE</a>.</p>
                <p>Students who live exceptionally far away from Dubuque should contact either <a href="mailto:david@colts.org">David</a> or the Colts office at (563-582-4872) to discuss how they can participate.  </p>

		</div>
	</div>
				<p><i>January 9, 2017</i></p>
                <p>At their November meeting, the Colts Board of Directors elected officers and additional Board members to oversee the organization for the 2016 - 2017 fiscal year.</p>
                <p>The board selected Peter Hansen to serve as President. Peter first joined the board in 2007 after having been a parent volunteer in 2005 and 2006. During his time on the board, Peter helped organize the Colts' appearance in the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Parade and has been responsible for running the Brass Impact show in the Kansas City area since 2010. Appointed to Vice President was Jim Johnson, who has been active with the Colts in various roles, including member, volunteer, board member, and corps director for the Colt Cadets. Bill Howes was reappointed to his position as Treasurer along with Bill Symoniak who will once again serve as Secretary for the coming year. Greg Blum will provide support as Past President of the board.</p>
                <p>The newest members of the board are Cathi Roberts and Gary Metzger.</p>
                <p>Cathi has been active as a volunteer since the 2014 season and currently leads the Red Team Thread Team, organizing the sewing of souvenir flags and uniform fitting and alterations. She has been active in various philanthropic endeavors throughout the Omaha area, including holding a seat on the board of directors for the League of Women Voters of Greater Omaha and serving on the Event Leadership Team for the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life for 12 years. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, she chaired the event and helped raise over $4,500,000. Her other volunteer experience includes guild member for Omaha Hearing School for Children, work with the St. Andrews UMC Youth Group, and a scout leader for two separate Girl Scout troops from 1995 - 2004. With her combination of nonprofit leadership, fundraising experience, and dedication to the organization, Cathi will bring much insight and a fresh perspective to the board.</p>
                <p>Gary has been an active volunteer with the Colts since the 2011 season when his daughter joined the Colts. He and his wife, Micki, each spend a week over the summer as head cook on the cook truck with the Colts. Gary brings with him a background of financials, having worked for an accounting agency and tax firm for many years. In his spare time, Gary is a member of the Waukesha Area Symphonic Band, playing bass trombone for the community group. Gary started with the Waukesha Area Symphonic Band in the 2016 - 2017 concert season. With his background in finance and experience as a long-term volunteer with the organization, Gary is sure to be a great addition to the board.</p>
                <p>Thank you to all who have accepted positions on the board. And thanks to all have served in the past. Your hours of volunteerism are a great example for our entire Colts family of what it takes to be great!</p>

If you plan on using either of these airports, please let <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> know prior to booking flights.</p>

<p>If you need help finding a ride to camp, or to arrange rides from an airport or bus station, please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a> or call 563-582-4872. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href="rsvp.cfm" target="blank">RSVP</a>. All flight details should also be listed on your RSVP.</p>

<p><b>MEMBERSHIP PROCESS & CONTRACTS</b><br>
There are positions available in every section of the corps. Individuals attending our first events are given priority over those who do not attend these rehearsals. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.</p>

<p>If this is your second or third rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.</p>

<p>Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else.</p>

<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance with the office through the <a href="rsvp.cfm" target="blank">RSVP</a> form. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.</p>
 
<p>If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>

<p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a location to be announced at check in. Bring all of your questions!</p>
 
<p>Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.</p>

<p>Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand.</p>
 
<p>Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school, or you can find a discounted rate at the <a href="http://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="blank" >Hampton Inn</a> here in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at (563)-690-2005 and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate.</p>
 
<p>Parents are encouraged to sign onto the <a href="http://www.colts.org/signupform.html" target="blank">email mailing list</a> to receive Colts information via email.</p>
 
<p>All parents and volunteers are Colts Boosters! Plan on joining us Saturday morning, before or after breakfast (approximately 9 am), to divide for Saturday projects. If you arrive at a random time, the kitchen and check in tables are good places to start with questions about where you can help.</p>

<p><b>SOUVENIR SALES</b><br>
Throughout the weekend, all items in the <a href="http://store-colts-org.3dcartstores.com" target="blank">Colts Mall</a> will be available for sale! Anyone is able to purchase souvenirs - students, parents, friends, family, etc. The souvenir racks will be set up by the check-in table, and you can purchase your items there. There will even be a few new items available for purchase!</p>
