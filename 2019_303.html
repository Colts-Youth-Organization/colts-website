                <p><i>December 2, 2018</i></p>
                
                <p><p>The December Gainesville rehearsal and audition for the 2020 Colts will be held Sunday, December 15, at the University of Florida in Gainesville. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+of+Florida/@29.6442513,-82.3552175,666m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88e8a30cfbe49275:0x206fe0de143d9886!8m2!3d29.6436324!4d-82.3549305" target="_blank">Click here for a Google map to the facility.</a> Camp check-in will begin at 8:30 AM in the University of Florida Music Building. Please enter from the south side of the building. You can <a href="img/news/dec_gainesville_parking.jpg" target="_blank">click here for a map of campus</a>, with parking locations and directions for the camp.</p>

                <p><b>Always check <a href="http://www.colts.org">colts.org</a> before leaving for camp for any last-minute updates!</b></p>

                <br>
                <p><b>TRAVEL PLANS</b><br>
                The Colts do not provide transportation to or from the Gainesville airport for this event. The school is only six miles from the Gainesville Regional Airport, so services like UBER, Lyft, or taxi should be available and relatively inexpensive. You should still include all flight details on your RSVP. If you need help finding a ride to camp please notify us ASAP by email at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can also let us know if you have extra room or if you need assistance on your <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a>. </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>PARKING</b><br>
                Parking is available on campus throughout the day. You can <a href="img/news/dec_gainesville_parking.jpg" target="_blank">click here for a map of campus</a>, with parking locations and directions for the camp.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>CAMP PAPERWORK</b><br>
                Prior to camp, you will be expected to turn in:<br>
                <ul>
					<li><a href="rsvp.html" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. Regardless of your plans, submit an RSVP so we can keep you up to date. Be sure to include all necessary flight and travel information in the RSVP. The RSVP should be submitted each month by interested students.</li>
					<li><a href="memberapp.html" target="_blank">Member Application</a>. Submit your application in advance to save time at check in. All auditioning students <b>must</b> submit a member application. The application only needs to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes</li>
                    <li>Email a headshot of yourself to <a href="mailto:jason@colts.org">jason@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last), section, and which audition camp you are attending. This picture is added to your audition file so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. This picture must be submitted before the camp starts and is required of all attending. Make sure the image is clear, well lit, and contains your whole face. And, as great as your sunglasses or Snapchat filters may look, they don't belong in your headshot.</li>
				</ul>
                When you arrive to check in, bring with you:<br>
                <ul>
                	<li><a href="documents/MedicalForm2020.pdf" target="_blank">Colts Medical History Form</a>. This form is <b>required</b> in order to audition. The medical form also provides permission to participate in our activities. Students 18 or older may sign their own medical form. Any student 17 or younger must have a parent or guardian signature to participate. Medical forms only need to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes. Be sure to complete both sides!</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the day. <b>Don't forget to bring a water bottle!</b><br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you have absolutely no access to an instrument and need one provided, contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest. You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude, or excerpt you feel comfortable with. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group<br>
                <br>
                 Color Guard: Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), <b>your own flag, rifle, and/or sabre</b>, and knee pads (definitely recommended). There is no need to purchase any special equipment for rehearsals. You will wear your audition t-shirt for all rehearsal segments through the day.<br>
                 <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
All positions in the corps are open. Following the camp, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly. Recall auditions can be scheduled three weeks after your initial audition at one of our events. Attend early and attend often for your best chance at a position in the Colts.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the camp is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
				<br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting for parents will be held Sunday morning at 11:00 AM. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check in table with locations for everything going on throughout the day.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the camp. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
