                <p>For 40 years, Ron has been designing programs and instructing drum corps, bands and color guards.</p>
                <p>He came to the Colts in 1990 with his friend and fellow Colts Hall of Famer ('15) Jeff Bridges. Together, they reimagined the Colts visual program with Jeff as designer and Ron as teacher. He was Jeff&rsquo;s right-hand man on staff and made sure the instructional staff followed procedures in rehearsal. According to J.B., &ldquo;It is my belief he was as much a part of the success of the corps through the '90s as any other staff member including myself.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Ron was the ultimate team player. For the Colts, he would teach, drive, and help with any job that needed to be done. He was a great ear for members to talk to on a daily basis. He was a great listener and counselor for staff and members. Ron was the calm, level-headed-balance guy that could bring peace to any emotional situation on tour.</p>
                <p>Dedicated, committed, helpful and, most importantly, caring.</p>
                <p>For these traits and many others too numerous to mention here, Ron Coleman has absolutely earned the honor of being in the Colts Hall of Fame.</p>
                <br>
                <a name="felderman" id="felderman"><strong>Nancy (Said) Felderman</strong></a>
                <p>After joining the Colts in 1966, Nancy (Said) Felderman was instrumental to developing the attitude of the color guard through the early 1970s. Jim Killoran (Colts HOF'17) described Nancy as &ldquo;one of the fiercest competitors I have ever had the opportunity to teach.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Nancy and the rest of the color guard participated in their first color guard championship in 1968, and in 1969, the corps won both the state championship and the Mid-America Drum Corps Circuit Championship.</p>
                <p>Nancy then earned the role of guard captain in 1970 and helped lead both the corps and color guard to championship victories before winning another color guard championship in 1971 and a corps championship in 1972 at the Iowa State American Legion Championship.</p>
                <p>Jim said, &ldquo;Nancy exemplified the spirit, the attitude, and the initiative that remains with the Colts today. Nancy is truly a gem and she is a one of the original members of the guard who set the standards that the Colts have followed for the past 57 years.&rdquo;</p>
                <br>
                <a name="hansen" id="hansen"><strong>Peter Hansen</strong></a>
                <p>Peter attended his first audition weekend with son, Chris, in the fall of 2004. He had always been a &ldquo;doer&rdquo; and he jumped in to volunteer any way he could.</p>
                <p>Following Chris&rsquo; second season in the baritone section, he arrived for fall rehearsals — again with his dad. With an abundance of parents in the kitchen, Peter decided to attend a Saturday meeting of the Board of Directors just to see what was going on. He was welcomed in and was formally elected to the Board in 2007.</p>
                <p>Peter was always a Board member to speak his mind, challenge convention, and try to push to the organization to greater achievement. While the Colts would eventually charter buses (as they do today), Peter was a long-time proponent of &ldquo;getting out of the bus business.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Peter was then splitting time between the family’s home in Lawrence, Kansas, and his wife’s apartment in Washington, D.C., where Gail had taken a job with the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
                <p>Following the historic election of the first black President of the United States, Peter conceived and organized the Colts Presidential Inaugural Parade participation in January 2009. The parade was not only an amazing opportunity for alumni to &ldquo;put on the Reds&rdquo; one more time, it also became a significant fundraiser for the organization.</p>
                <p>When the Colts looked to expand their hosted events in 2010, Peter organized the first Colts-sponsored DCI show in the Kansas City metro area. Even though his residence has now permanently shifted from Lawrence, Kansas, to Washington, D.C., he continues to coordinate the show to this day — although he is aggressively seeking a replacement.</p>
                <p>Peter became President of the Board in 2017, serving just two years, because his goal was to begin a regular succession of Board leadership — two years V.P., two years as President, and two years Past President.</p>
                <p>As President, he became very involved in fundraising with special attention to large capital campaign projects. He helped drive several fundraising efforts including last year’s successful &ldquo;Carry The Load&rdquo; Campaign to replace both of the Colts semitrailers.</p>
                <p>According to Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane, &ldquo;Actually, I just wanted to build the equipment trailer and leave the kitchen trailer for the following year. But Peter pushed us to fundraise for both at the same time and it worked.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Peter remains engaged in fundraising and cultivating donors in his time as Past President. In addition to building the Colts donor base, Peter and his wife, Gail, have themselves been generous supporters throughout the years. And now that they are in D.C., they like to take a day and make smoothies for the entire drum corps on a day that the Colts are heading up the East Coast.</p>

                <a name="johnson" id="johnson"><strong>Jim Johnson</strong></a>
                <p>Following a recommendation from then-drum major Ky Hascall, Jim Johnson joined the Colts in 1989, looking for a way to enhance his knowledge and skills for his future in music education. Jim played baritone for two years before aging out in 1990.</p>
                <p>Prior to his age-out season, Jim began working in the Colts office, which continued into seasonal employment through 1992, having also been hired to teach brass and visual beginning in 1991. Jim’s graduation, full-time employment, and a move to Indiana brought his employment to an end mid-season 1992, but in 1996, Jim was hired to be the Director of the Colt Cadets. He served in that role in 1996 and 1997, simultaneously serving as the de facto brass caption head, tour manager, and 1997 drill writer.</p>
                <p>In 1997, Jim experienced another college graduation, cross-country move, and a return to full-time employment, ending his close involvement with the Colt Cadets. He kept hanging around, though, and by that time he had pulled his partner Barry Magee into the activity as a frequent volunteer. Eventually, Barry became one of the recurring head cooks for the Colts, and when another job transition freed up Jim’s summers in 2001, Jim began his career as a cooktruck volunteer. Jim and Barry were regulars on the cooktruck until 2009, and Jim returned to occasional stints in that role a few years later.</p>
                <p>Jim joined the Board of Directors in 2015 and served as a member for three years before being elected President at the end of 2018.</p>
                <p>Beyond the Colts, Jim was involved with the Drums On The Ohio competition in Evansville, IN between 1993 and 2001, serving as co-chair in 2000 and show chairman in 2001. He volunteered annually for Drum Corps International from 2008-2019, serving as local chair and site liaison for the Corps Experience Committee in 2008-2009.</p>
                <p>Jim currently lives in Bloomington, IN with his husband Barry and two dogs, and he works at Indiana University as the Associate Director of the Student Involvement and Leadership Center. His professional work includes oversight of student organizations, leadership programs, and community engagement initiatives.</p>

                <a name="kenyon" id="kenyon"><strong>Doug Kenyon</strong></a>
                <p>Doug &ldquo;Moonwhale&rdquo; Kenyon was an inspiration to everyone who stood on the same field with him back in the 1970s. He played the game harder than anyone of his era. His motor was always running with his foot on the gas, even when the stick shift was in Park. And that rubbed off on everyone around him.</p>
                <p>Doug carried a little more weight than many, but he still marked time higher (remember, members used to mark time by bringing your foot to your knee), he played with more intensity, and he was almost always the first one back to reset for the next rep. And his effort paid off.</p>
                <p>Scanning through an old Drum Corps Planet forum about the best soloists that were not sopranos (trumpets), Doug&rsquo;s name appears regularly — along with 2018 Colts HOF inductee David Lang. Doug was the Colts resident baritone soloist in mid- to late-'70s, and after seven dedicated years here, he took his talents to the West Coast to spend one season with the Concord Blue Devils. And, of course, he was featured there in 1980 as half of the &ldquo;Dindi&rdquo; duet.</p>
                <p>But he wasn’t done. Doug, now known as &ldquo;Pooh Bear,&rdquo; would go on to march in many all-age groups including the Kilties, Royal-Aires, and Renegades. He marched in the Anaheim Kingsmen Alumni Corps at the 2007 DCI World Championships in the Rose Bowl.</p>
                <p>Doug married his Colts sweetheart, Cindy Steichen, and together they brought another amazing drum corps performer into the world. Kayla began in the Colt Cadets color guard in 2002 and finished her drum corps career a dozen years later, just months after Dad was taken by cancer. He was very proud of his daughter.</p>
                <p>For these reasons, and many others that memory will later confirm, Doug &ldquo;Moonwhale&rdquo; Kenyon takes his rightful place in the 2020 Colts Hall of Fame. Doug would have just turned 60 in July of this year. His time has come to receive the Colts highest honor. R.I.P. Moony!</p>
