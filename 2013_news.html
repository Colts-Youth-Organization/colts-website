                <p>Sincere best wishes to our entire Colts family for a wonderful holiday season. We are blessed to be surrounded by such an amazing group of young performers, a selfless collection of volunteers without whom we would be lost, and a hard-working staff who keep all the pieces put together.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMU2QrbA0-Y">CLICK HERE</a> to enjoy a bit of "Winter" as performed by the 1993 Colts Drum & Bugle Corps with Eric Weber on solo trumpet.</p>
                <p>"Winter" was written by Brass Arranger and Colts alum Chuck Naffier, who has returned to the Colts to create the brass music for the upcoming season. This opening to the 1993 show would be the first song performed by the Colts in Drum Corps International World Championship Finals competition. <i>We will have to wait a few months to see what Santa has under the tree for this year's corps.</i></p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Prepare For Next 50 Years</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>November 25, 2013</i></p>
      			<p>Following a memorable season in which it celebrated its 50th Anniversary, the Colts Youth Organization is preparing for the next 50 years without its most familiar face. Greg Orwoll, the group's development director and former executive director, recently accepted a new challenge as executive director of DuRide in Dubuque. Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane manages the Colts business operation and will take on many of the duties vacated by Orwoll's departure.</p>
                <p>"Greg created a wonderful foundation on which we will continue to build the Colts. His philosophies used to develop young students into accomplished leaders and performers will live on here forever," said MacFarlane. "We will certainly miss his three decades of leadership, but I have his number and know he will be there when we need some advice or counsel."</p>
                <p>MacFarlane has been with the Colts Youth Organization since 2005 serving as controller and designer. Prior to joining the Colts, he was more known throughout Dubuque for creating many of the area's iconic logo designs at the company he founded, Get Smart Design (which later became Mission Creative  a property of Woodward Communications). He spent over twenty years in the advertising business before shifting gears and joining the non-profit organization where he participated as a drummer in the 1970s. He grew up with the Colts having watched all four of his older siblings march in the drum corps.</p>
                <p>"I used to get a call from Greg every now and then to do a pro bono design project for the Colts," MacFarlane continued. "I look forward to bringing a bit of that marketing focus to the organization as we refine the Colts brand, and spread the word about our mission and the accomplishments of these amazing students we meet year after year."</p>
                <p>The Colts bring one season to a close and begin another this weekend when they host their Annual Recognition Banquet on Friday, November 29th followed immediately by their first audition weekend. There is still plenty of time to sign up (<a href="/rsvp.cfm">www.colts.org/rsvp</a>) and become a member of the 2014 Colts!</p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>August 31, 2013</i></p>
      			<p>As August draws to a close, what a great time to reflect on all that's transpired over the past year. We welcomed in our 50th Anniversary, having been founded in 1963, and celebrated throughout the summer as alumni, parents, fans and friends. Thank you to all who performed, donated, volunteered, bought a ticket or a souvenir, taught, or in any other way helped our programs experience the pursuit of our common cause...<i>to use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life.</i> <b>Following are just some of the highlights from this memorable year of the Colts Youth Organization:</b></p>
                <p>MARC SYLVESTER HIRED AS COLTS PROGRAM COORDINATOR<br>
Soon after Vicki (Schaffer) MacFarlane was named Colts director, she got right to work and named Marc Sylvester to lead the Colts design team as program coordinator for the 2013 season. "Sully," as he has been known throughout the activity for over 30 years, brought his Hall of Fame toolbox to Dubuque to begin painting a fresh canvas for the Colts in their anniversary season. Joining Marc on the design team were returning members Chris Tomsa, brass arranger; Dave Nelson, percussion arranger; Carla Burgess-Tomsa, color guard supervisor; and Brandon Smith, guard designer. Also adding his creativity to the Colts design team in his first year was Aaron Guidry, composer and electronics supervisor.</p>

				<p>MATT MULVANNY NAMED COLT CADETS DIRECTOR<br>
Matt Mulvanny was named director of the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps in September 2012. A Colts alumnus from 2006, Matt had been on staff with the cadet corps for two seasons, serving as a leader in the marching program and a key member of the brass staff. Matt's excitement for the season was unmistakable, "I'm looking forward to working alongside an instructional and design staff that continues to inspire the drum corps community every year. Filling the shoes of Vicki (Schaffer) MacFarlane is not a task anybody should take lightly, but with such hard working members, and support from a family of staff that gels so well together, I could not be more enthusiastic about the future of the Colt Cadets."</p>

				<p>SUMMERTIME IN THE DEAD OF WINTER<br>
At the February rehearsal weekend, the Colts brass line had the rare opportunity to perform with one of its own from four decades prior. Greg Blum, current president of the Colts Board of Directors, came to prominence within the drum corps activity in the early '80s as soloist on the Colts classic, <i>Summertime</i>. He sat down with Colts videographer Isaac Campbell following the performance to discuss the significance of this piece of Colts history. Isaac produced the interview for his campus television station at the University of Northern Iowa.</p>

				<p>COLTS BOOSTER CLUB HOSTS 3-FOR-1 RAFFLE<br>  
The Colts Booster Club held a $10-per-ticket fundraising raffle throughout the spring and summer. Tickets were sold at Colts camps, Colts Bingo, Winter Farmer's Market here in the Colts Center, and a variety of other venues including our host events. The winners of the 2013 Colts Booster Club Raffle were: Jennifer Murphy from Benton, WI ($1,000), Andrew Eaton from Roselle, IL ($1,500), and Dave Guthrie from Hopkinton, IA ($5,000). Plans are being discussed to host another raffle next year with a few changes to make the event even more exciting, and to introduce the 2014 raffle at the November weekend audition camp. What a wonderful stocking stuffer for anyone on your gift list...<i>so long as they are 18 years old and eligible for the grand prize!</i> Thank you to everyone who participated in this year's raffle!</p>

				<p>UNIFORM DEDICATION CAMPAIGN RAISES FINAL FUNDING FOR NEW LOOK<br>
The Colts and Colt Cadets were outfitted in new uniforms for the 50th Anniversary thanks in large part to a 2012 grant from the Dubuque Racing Association. Renowned uniform designer Michael Cesario worked with Marc Sylvester to establish the look, and the great team at Fred J. Miller (FJM) brought the uniform to life. The DRA grant required a 25% match from the organization and when development director Greg Orwoll posed the challenge to our supporters, they responded enthusiastically. For $65, a donor could dedicate a uniform in their name or in remembrance of another. Some of the most moving dedications were in honor of Colts family members who are no longer with us. Thank you to all who supported this new look for the Colts and Colt Cadets.</p>

				<p>COLTS NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP COLOR GUARD HONORED<br>
As part of the 50th Anniversary events, the Colts took a moment to recognize the first national championship in the organization's history. The 2013 Colts members served as the audience while several members and instructional staff of the 1976 Colts Color Guard were introduced and presented with triangles for the years they marched. The guard won the Midwest Circuit Color Guard Championship in Chicago followed by the VFW National Color Guard Championship later in the summer. Following a slideshow tribute, all in attendance were treated to the championship performance which was preserved on 8mm videotape by none other than 1976 corps director Tom Faulkner (who, BTW, was also in attendance).</p>

				<p>COLTS DEBUT NEW LOOK AT MEMORIAL DAY FESTIVITIES IN DUBUQUE<br>
The Colts celebrated the men and women of the United States Armed Forces by participating in the annual Memorial Day parade in downtown Dubuque followed by their tribute concert in Washington Park. The day also marked the public debut of their new uniforms. For new and veteran Colts alike, becoming the first person to wear a new corps uniform is a unique experience.</p>

				<p>COLTS CAR WASH REACHES AN ALL-TIME HIGH IN DONATIONS<br>
What a better way to experience the 26th Annual Colts Car Wash than with a brand new BMW and time lapse footage? <i>(See video)</i> Washing over 800 cars at 20 different locations, the annual fundraiser raised over $33,800 (and counting) for the Colts Youth Organization. Thank you to the businesses that hosted a site, parents, volunteers, members and supporters who made the event such a huge success. Also, special thanks to Doug and Matt Warthan of BMW Dubuque for providing a BMW 3 Series automobile for the day!</p>

				<p>COLTS RECEIVE GENEROUS GRANTS FROM THE DRA AND CITY OF DUBUQUE<br>
The Colts announced in July that they were awarded a $40,000 grant from the City of Dubuque as part of the its Arts & Culture Funding Program. The city supports arts and culture by recognizing the contribution such organizations make to the quality of life in the community as well as the significance of their economic impact. The Dubuque Racing Association awarded a grant to the Colts Youth Organization to be used for the replacement of the roof at the Colts Center. Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $340,000 for new instruments, vehicles, uniforms, a souvenir trailer, computers and equipment maintenance. The contributions of these two groups have been critical to our ability to provide top-notch programs for our 300+ students.</p>

				<p>COLTS VISIT THE ORIGINAL FIELD OF DREAMS<br>
Celebrating the end of Cornfield Tour, and being the inspiration for their 2013 program, the corps visited the famed movie site just outside of Dyersville, Iowa. The trip presented an opportunity to perform their 2013 ballad on the actual Field Of Dreams. Members of the Colts, Colt Cadets, board members, staff and alumni were on hand for this memorable event.</p>

				<p>PANDEMONIUM ENJOYS JAMMIN' FOR THE CROWDS<br>
Pandemonium, the Colts-sponsored steel drum ensemble directed by Patti Millius, took on their busiest summer schedule to date beginning with a performance at the Colts Summer Premiere at Loras College on June 22nd, and finishing in early August. Since 2009, Pandemonium has been entertaining audiences while learning a unique blend of melody and rhythm using a wide variety of popular music. The Colts also sponsor the PanrythmiX Steel Drum Ensemble for students in grades 4-5 attending Prescott Elementary School.</p>

				<p>HAV LIFE: WHERE OPPORTUNITY MEETS POTENTIAL<br>
Started in memory of Hunter Aaron Vondran, HAVlife is a not for profit foundation that was established to fund the resources students need to pursue their musical aspirations and athletic goals - just like Hunter did. This past summer, HAVlife provided a grant of $5,000 to assist members of the Colt Cadets who may otherwise have not been able to afford their drum corps membership. We are thrilled to have established this partnership and look forward to turning lost potential into long-term achievement in the years to come.</p>

				<p>COLTS SUMMER BAND PROVIDES AN EVENING OF MUSIC IN THE PARK<br>
For the seventh consecutive summer, the Colts Summer Band capped their season with a wonderful concert in Eagle Point Park on Tuesday, July 2nd, along with the Colt Cadets. While the size of the summer band remained consistent with 2012, a common review of the concert from those in attendance was, "This is the best the summer band has EVER sounded!" Congratulations to directors Brian Enabnit and Dan Norman for providing an incredible experience for this ambitious group of students!</p> 

				<p>MUSIC ON THE MARCH MAKES NEW DALZELL FIELD DEBUT<br>
Eight drum and bugle corps rolled onto the campus of Dubuque Senior High School on Friday, July 12th, and delivered their world-class performances to a packed house at the newly-remodeled Dalzell Field. The local crowd was enthusiastic and supportive, as they have been for several decades, and Mother Nature cooperated with a spectacular night just up until the time a swarm of mayflies made its way from the Mississippi River to the lights of the stadium. Most in the crowd were not going to let a few summer pests ruin their evening that concluded with recognition of the Colts age outs and encore performances by the Colt Cadets, Colts and the 50th Anniversary Colts Alumni Corps.</p>

				<p>COLTS ALUMNI CORPS PERFORMS AT HOME SHOW AND DCI CHAMPIONSHIPS<br>
Brass members from throughout the years joined together to revive a few classics from the Colts repertoire. Thank you to LeAnn Splitter for organizing the group and to all who participated. The alumni corps was complimented in Dubuque by a color guard unit that fashioned uniforms from throughout Colts history, and was lead by former color guard sergeant Jolene (Miller) O'Toole. Many members of the brass group, along with a few others who joined for the Indianapolis event, performed in Lucas Oil Stadium following the DCI World Class Semifinals as they played the 2013 DCI age out class onto the field for their recognition ceremony. The group also performed on Georgia Street earlier in the evening, and finally at the DCI Championships After-Party on Friday night at the Omni Severin Hotel in downtown Indianapolis.</p>

				<p>COLTS FAMILY GATHERS AS ONE FOR 50TH ANNIVERSARY REUNION<br>
On Saturday, July 13th, alumni who marched throughout the past five decades, along with many parents and others who offered their support, gathered at the Holiday Inn in downtown Dubuque for an evening filled with stories and memories of days gone by. Emceed by Colts board member Emily Neuendorf, the evening included a few comedic moments from our own Fruit Of The Loom leaf, Gene Steichen, and a great story of perseverance from '90s alum and former staff member Kent Lineberry. The history of the triangle was discussed, and the significance of the medals now given to members who march, and then all of the alums were presented with a triangle commemorating each of their years in the Colts. The evening concluded with Vox One's rendition of the corps song, <i>Morning.</i></p>

				<p>COLTS AND COLT CADETS TAKE A STEP FORWARD<br>
The Colts and Colt Cadets each took a step forward within their competitive divisions at the DCI World Championships in Michigan City and Indianapolis. The Colt Cadets reached DCI Open Class Finals for the fourth consecutive year and achieved the highest placement in their history (10th) with their show titled, Red. The Colts 2013 program, Field Of Dreams, was a crowd favorite all season long and the members performed with incredible energy throughout the week. Congratulations to all of the members of both corps who have now joined in the great tradition of Colts and Colt Cadets who've performed throughout the past 50 years. You have laid the foundation on which the next 50 years will be built!</p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>July 16, 2013</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts $40,000 grant from the City of Dubuque was approved by the Dubuque City Council for the fiscal year 2014 budget, which began July 1.</p>
                <p>A total of 16 organizations submitted grants for this program, and each organization was evaluated by a volunteer commission as to the relative impact on the Arts and Culture goals contained in the City of Dubuque's Vision and MIssion.</p>
                <p>Funding was determined by using a combination of the overall evaluated score and the size of the organization's operating budget.  The Colts ranked 2nd overall in their contribution to the city's objectives, with a 95.3% rating.</p>
                <p>The City of Dubuque has made it a priority to support Arts and Culture in the city, recognizing both the contribution the arts make to the quality of life but also the importance and significance of the economic impact the arts and culture make.</p>
                <p>In total, the 16 non profit arts and culture organizations who were qualified for funding received grants ranging from $1,061 to $40,000.</p>
                <p>The Colts are proud of their contribution to the quality of life in Dubuque and of their support of the goals and objectives of the City of Dubuque.</p>
                <p>Dubuque is a three-time All American City Designee, most recently again this year. </p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>May 30, 2013</i></p>
      			<p>TThe Dubuque Racing Association, (DRA) is the non-profit organization that is the license holder for the Mystique and the Diamond Jo casinos.  Grants have been offered to non-profit organizations through a competitive grants process most every year since 1985.</p>
                <p>Significant funds also are contributed to the City of Dubuque from the DRA.</p>
                <p>The last two years, the DRA awarded the Colts the maximum amount offered both years, $40,000 last year for new uniforms for both the Colts and the Colt Cadets in commemoration of the 50th anniversary season of the Colts, and this year, the maximum $25,000.</p>
                <p>Both grants came with a requirement of a match of an additional 25% or more. For the new uniforms for the Colts and the Colt Cadets, 230 in total, donors were given the opportunity to dedicate a uniform for a contribution of $65 per uniform. A total of 237 uniforms were dedicated by donors this spring.</p>
                <p>The Colts wore the new uniforms in the Memorial Day Parade in Dubuque and the Colt Cadets will show off their new uniforms at Brass 'n' Brats in Belmont, Wisconsin on Tuesday, June 11.</p>
                <p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $340,000 for new instruments, vehicles, uniforms, a souvenir trailer, computers and equipment maintenance.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Brass Member Dakotah Coach, 18, Presumed Drowned</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>May 14, 2013</i></p>
      			<p>With heavy hearts, we received a call this morning from Shane Coach, father of second-year brass member Dakotah Coach, who informed us that it appeared Dakotah and his friend, Erika Borgstrom, jumped from the Stone Arch Bridge in Minneapolis and are presumed to have drowned in the Mississippi River. The two had been reported missing since last Friday evening.</p>
                <p>Witnesses reported seeing two people jump from the bridge around 4:30 a.m. this morning. It is believed they have drowned but police continue their search. Tuesday afternoon, St. Croix Central High School principal Glenn Webb released this statement:</p>
                <p>"The St. Croix Central School District community is grieving the loss of two wonderful students. Erika Borgstrom, a sophomore, and Dakotah Coach, a senior, took their own lives early Tuesday morning, May 14, 2013. Both were excellent students and outstanding musicians. They will be missed greatly by all who knew them. Our thoughts, prayers and support go out to their families, friends and the entire community during this very difficult time."</p>
                <p>The Colts send prayers and sincere condolences to the teens' families. Dakotah's father, Shane, has been a regular volunteer at Colts weekend rehearsal camps, along with his grandparents, with whom Dakotah was very close.</p>
                <p>Dakotah Coach embraced many of the qualities that make everyone in the Colts family so proud of its members. We remember the Dakotah we met last spring who came to his first drum corps audition young and inexperienced. Earning a position was not easy for Dakotah, and he had to push himself to a level that he may not have known existed. He persevered. He continued working toward his goal, and on Memorial Day, a year ago, he slipped into his uniform jacket for the first time as a member of the 2012 Colts Drum & Bugle Corps. He struggled through the "Cornfield Tour," pushed himself even further still throughout the summer, and when the season concluded at the Colts annual awards banquet in November, his peers had voted him one of the two Most Improved Members of the brass section.</p>
                <p>Dakotah returned in November 2012 to once again earn his position within the drum corps. He had a contract to be a member of 2013 Colts and was scheduled to move-in for summer over the Memorial Day weekend. His wonderful presence - on the field, on the bus, and in the hearts of his Colts brothers and sisters - will live on.</p>

                <p>These rehearsals are approached as clinics, so that any young person can explore drum corps membership without the full commitment. This allows students to explore a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best.</p>
                <p>The Colt Cadets rehearse three Sundays per month during the school year. During the summer the corps rehearses Tuesday through Thursday and Saturday. The group will travel about 23 days during the summer months, and will perform for more than 75,000 people in 7 states. In 2013, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Last season marked the third consecutive year the Colt Cadets were Open Class Finalists.</p>
                <p>It is possible to make a variety of summer schedules work! Many members are able to participate in other summer activities while performing with the Colt Cadets. If you have questions about your specific summer plans, do not hesitate to call or email, and feel free to bring your summer schedule to an open rehearsal. Our staff will provide more insight on how to balance summer plans.</p>
                <p>All instruments, uniforms, and instruction are provided, and individuals will be provided with opportunities to help earn some, or all, of the membership fees.</p>
                <p>Please call 563-582-4872 or e-mail <a href="mailto:matt@colts.org">Matt Mulvanny</a>, Colt Cadets Director, with any questions! We will help in any way we can!</p>
                <p>Anyone unavailable for the kick-off event may attend our second scheduled rehearsal on February 24th. Students who live exceptionally far away from Dubuque should contact the either Matt or the office directly to discuss their rehearsal options.</p>
                <p>Veteran Colt Cadet members and their families are encouraged to attend the 2013 kick-off and leadership meeting during Colts camp on February 10th at Washington Middle School.
