While he loves performing, Mitchell's true passion lies in teaching, and he began pursuing this as a movement technician by choreographing for the Xavier High School color guard in 2008 and 2009. He moved on to teach, design, and choreograph for the Downers Grove South High School color guard from 2010 - 2013, and then worked as a guest clinician at the 2013 Iowa State University Winter Guard Spin Clinic in Ames, Iowa.</p>
