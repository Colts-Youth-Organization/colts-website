336,2021,3,31,Honoring Beth Miller For Women's History Month,"<div class=""row""><div class=""col-xs-12""> <img src=""/img/news/beth_miller.jpg"" height="""" width=""300px"" alt=""Beth Miller"" class=""float-start imageborder me-2"" /><p> We cannot think of a better way to conclude Women's History Month than to pay tribute to a great one. Beth Miller was both legend and legendary. She was ""all in"" when her daughter, Jolene, joined the Colt .45 Cadets color guard in 1967. Jolene, herself, became a Colts legend earning the nickname ""Trigger"" as color guard sergeant of the Colts championship winter guard in the mid-1970s.</p><p> Our earliest listing of board members shows Beth served as Booster Club Board President in 1974–1975. She also served as finance chair for the Corporate Board. She joined the Colts Corporate Board of Directors in 1976, continuing as finance chair, and in 1978 served her first year as the Corporate Board President — a role she would accept again from 1989–1991. She was a fixture on the board until her passing just two weeks after <i>Music On The March</i> in 2009.</p><p> ""Mom got involved two minutes after Bob Buelow let me in at 10 years old,"" said Colts Hall-of-Famer Jolene Miller O'Toole. ""She lobbied in Des Moines for bingo games and got many people to contribute to the corps. [It] made me stand back and go, 'Wow, what an amazing woman!'"" Beth preceded her daughter as the first woman selected into the Colts Hall of Fame in 1994.</p><p> Beth did not just occupy a board seat. She used her skills as a telephone company sales representative to secure advertising in the <i>Music On The March</i> program booklet. She got so much support from the business community that the booklet eventually topped out at 96 pages. The annual revenue Beth generated for <i>Music On The March</i> ensured the financial success of the event — rain or shine.</p><p> In November 1985, Bob Buelow and Board President Rich Theobald proclaimed, ""In recognition of her many years of service, energy and positive thinking, her strength of character, her guiding hand, her zeal and tireless labor, her morals and morale, and her resourcefulness and tenacity, we the members and boosters of the Colts proclaim Beth Miller 'Godmother of the Colts.'""</p><p> Former Board President (1999-2002) John Woodin shared this life lesson. ""I now have stronger toes because of Beth Miller. I spent some years as president of the Colts Board of Directors while Beth held board positions. My toes are stronger because Beth kept me on [them] during each of those years. Beth was dedicated to what the Colts are all about and was tireless in her efforts for the participants. Because of Beth's dedication to the organization, we are stronger, we are focused, and we are all on our toes.""</p><p>Former Board Member Glenn Baughman writes, ""Beth's legacy to the Colts is unique and without peer.""</p><p> And another former Board Member Rod Bakke maybe sums it up best: ""People may forget what you did. People may forget what you said. But people will never forget how you made them feel. Beth Miller made you feel good.""</p><p> We love you, Beth! We are here because of your dedication, determination and perseverance. And we hope your inspiration continues to drive the soul of our organization. On this last day of Women's History Month 2021, we salute the one and only Beth Miller.</p></div></div>"

""Developing this series of events give us an opportunity to perform for our communities while providing our members additional performances leading into Indianapolis.""</p><p> ""Foremost, our attention will be on safety,"" said Brad Furlano, Executive Director of the Blue Stars.

The specific combination of dates and locations will be announced later this spring.</p><p> ""The loss of the 2020 competitive season due to COVID-19 created financial challenges for all the drum corps,"" said Monte Mast, Executive Director of The Cavaliers.

332,2021,2,16,"DEI at forefront: Local arts, cultural organizations get to work","<div class=""row""><div class=""col-xs-12""><p><i>By Michelle London, Telegraph Herald; February 16, 2021</i></p>  <p>Diversity. Equity. Inclusion.</p>  <p>Three words. Lots of definitions.</p>  <p>Many are hearing these words a lot more lately. But what exactly do they mean?</p>  <p>Diversity is the representation of many different identities ‚Äî ethnicity, race, religion, gender or sexual orientation among them.</p>  <p>Equity is the equal and fair treatment of all those group, ensuring equal opportunity and access to resources for everyone.</p>  <p>Inclusion is inviting everyone to participate and contribute, creating a culture of belonging rather than exclusion.</p>  <p>DEI first rose in the 1970s and 1980s to address the inequity of gender in the workplace. In the 1990s, organizations expanded their scope to include other groups, as well.</p>  <p>In 2020, the subject of DEI became a topic of discussion at the forefront with the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain and other Blacks at the hands of law enforcement, with the lingering question of why Blacks are killed by police officers at a rate three times higher than Whites.</p>  <p>Politics aside, the discussion has made many groups, including arts and culture organizations in the tri-states, take a deeper look. Many unwritten policies are being crafted into DEI statements, and group and board members are collaborating to bring about change.</p>  <h2>Putting it in writing</h2>  <p>The City of Dubuque has made DEI a strong part of its mission through its Arts and Cultural Affairs Commission, according to Nick Halder, who serves on that commission.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to figure out what that looks like going forward,‚Äù he said.</p>  <p>Halder also is the producing artistic director of Rising Star Theatre Company in Dubuque and is the theater director-in-residence at Clarke University.</p>  <p>Halder said Rising Star is open to all who want to audition. Since implementing a youth program in 2010, anyone from ages 8 to 18 who audition is cast.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve historically tried to make sure that anyone who wants to participate can,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt changed. But we‚Äôre more mindful about creating opportunities that will reach out to underserved populations.‚Äù</p>  <p>Halder said there are more inroads to be made.</p>  <p>‚ÄúAll organizations in Dubuque are doing their best to push forward those efforts to offer programming that is diverse and inclusive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to be more intentional than we‚Äôve been in the past. We want to be sure we‚Äôve giving people what they need and what they want as opposed to telling them what they need and what they want.‚Äù</p>  <p>COVID-19 has caused many arts and culture groups to not only reassess their formerly unwritten policies or to create new statements of purpose but also to move toward tangible activities.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve taken this pandemic time to reflect as an organization,‚Äù Halder said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôve adopted this language, so how do we put it into action?‚Äô‚Äù</p>  <p>Halder also emphasized the need for more diversity among arts organization leaders.</p>  <p>‚ÄúA lot of the leaders of the arts organizations in Dubuque are White,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want to be sure that other people, in the Black community and others, have a seat at the table. This will help infuse more energy into these organizations long-term.‚Äù</p>  <h2>Task groups and committees</h2>  <p>DEAI (including accessibility as part of the acronym) is a topic of concern for area arts organizations. While most people think of physical accessibility when they hear the word, it can often refer to social, economic and educational accessibility as well.</p>  <p>The National Mississippi River Museum &amp; Aquarium and the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra both have formed working groups, comprised of staff, board and community members and, in the case of DSO, musicians.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe decided as an organization that DEAI needs to be a part of our fabric,‚Äù said Erin Dragotto, vice president of development at the museum. ‚ÄúWe started with what‚Äôs embedded into our strategic plan, our values, our mission. That includes inclusivity, but of course, we said that‚Äôs not enough. We needed to open up our eyes as to how we‚Äôre being seen.‚Äù</p>  <p>An internal working group has begun the process of creating a DEAI plan.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe have about 12 to 15 people in any given meeting, and we just started talking,‚Äù Dragotto said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working up a program that serves our staff, our visitors and our community.‚Äù</p>  <p>Wendy Scardino, the museum‚Äôs director of marketing and communications, said the Dubuque County Historical Society, which is housed at the museum, have taken DEAI steps as well.</p>  <p>‚ÄúThey are working hard to highlight equity within their exhibits,‚Äù Scardino said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about suffrage or about baseball in Dubuque. There‚Äôs a lot more that comes to mind. They‚Äôve been intentional in telling other stories through those exhibits.‚Äù</p>  <p>Scardino said a grant application has been made through the Institute for Museum and Library services to support the hiring of a DEAI coordinator. They‚Äôll know the results of that application later this year.</p>  <p>‚ÄúThe coordinator would help bridge those partnerships in a more equitable way, and work within our own staff to become more equitable,‚Äù she said.</p>  <p>One thing the group is working on is a SWOT analysis ‚Äî gauging the organization‚Äôs strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre acting consciously,‚Äù Dragotto said. ‚ÄúThis is a 21st century issue that is never going to go away, thankfully. And I mean that in a good way. There‚Äôs a lot of things to do. We have an end goal, but we don‚Äôt have a linear approach just yet. It‚Äôs really a work in progress.‚Äù</p>  <p>At the DSO, Executive Director Mark Wahlert is working on the symphony‚Äôs DEI statement with a task force of about a dozen members that was formed last fall.</p>  <p>‚ÄúOne of the things that we‚Äôre very proud of in the symphony from an artistic standpoint is that we‚Äôve done a really good job of bringing artists in from around the world and different backgrounds, but we‚Äôve never had anything formal,‚Äù he said.</p>  <p>Wahlert admitted it will be a difficult task.</p>  <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a challenge in Dubuque when you have something like 88% White,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe concept of DEI has come to the forefront for us in the last year or so, not only artistically, but what we can do to reach a broader audience.‚Äù</p>  <p>The symphony has developed rock concerts and country concerts as part of its annual offerings and has invited hip-hop artists to perform.</p>  <p>But Wahlert said they plan to do more.</p>  <p>‚ÄúRace is at the top of the list, but we‚Äôre looking at LGBTQ composers and artists, women artists, different age groups,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at a broad spectrum of things as far as diversity and looking at what we‚Äôve been doing well and where we need improvement.‚Äù</p>  <p>Those discussions will lead to action plans and a DEI policy that he hopes will result in positive outcomes.</p>  <p>‚ÄúRight now, it‚Äôs just self-analysis,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf people don‚Äôt feel welcome or don‚Äôt have the means, those are the things we hope to counteract. We want to target those people who need us the most.‚Äù</p>  <h2>Young adults have their say</h2>  <p>The <strong>Dubuque Colts Drum &amp; Bugle Corps</strong> also is working to craft its DEI statement.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had a formal policy prior to this year,‚Äù said Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been an open organization. That said, we felt it was time to formalize what has always been an unwritten policy.‚Äù</p>  <p>Vicki MacFarlane, director of the organization‚Äôs youth programs and drum and bugle corps, said the group always has had a strong LGBTQ representation. The group is audition-based, and because of the competitive nature of drum and bugle corps nationally, draws from a wide demographic.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe are probably a little more diverse than Dubuque or Iowa,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIn a normal year, we have 500 students audition for 154 spots. Last year, we had students audition who came from 28 states and four countries.‚Äù</p>  <p>As far as accessibility, board member Michelle McKnelly said socio-economics is a major factor.</p>  <p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this real urban/rural divide, where students who live in rural areas don‚Äôt have the access to the kind of music education that students who live in urban or suburban areas do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also the divide of economics.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has caused some industries to shut down completely, it's caused others to reinvent their approach. When your business is music and leadership training, the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps chose the latter, developing an online curriculum to replace their normal summer tour.</p>  <p>The group typically brings about 200 students and staff to Dubuque each Memorial Day weekend to begin nearly 80 days of rehearsals and competitive performances around the country, but on March 26, the 2020 Drum Corps International summer tour was canceled.</p>  <p>Using the moniker, <i>Colts Homeroom,</i> the organization developed a 16-week program to give students the opportunity to continue their education at home through online classes, even as social distancing regulations evolve. To keep students engaged while they juggle other responsibilities throughout the summer, the classes are presented in an asynchronous format, allowing each student to work through lessons on their own time.</p>  <div class=""alignright imageborder"">  <img src=""/img/news/ChadMiller.jpg"" width=""200px"" alt=""Chad Miller headshot""/>  <p style=""margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;"" class=""small"">Chad Miller</p> </div>  <p>""This is meant to not overwhelm each student, as many are oversaturated with e-learning,‚Äù said Chad Miller, brass caption head for the Colts.

""It has turned into an educational tool to expose our students to facets of music that we normally would not be able to explore given the restraints of time on tour.""</p>  <p>Masterclass topics have included show design, music composition, gigging, and interviews with well-known performers, including Jeff Conners of the Boston Brass.

""It has also allowed us to give our membership a deeper understanding of what professionals do in their lives as musicians, designers, and educators.""</p>  <div class=""alignleft imageborder"">  <img src=""/img/news/VickiMacFarlane.jpg"" width=""200px"" class=""alignleft imageborder""/>  <p style=""margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;"" class=""small"">Vicki MacFarlane</p> </div>  <p>Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane said she's glad the organization has been able to pivot and remain active through the pandemic.</p>  <p>""When COVID-19 initially hit, our immediate worry went to our staff and students,"" MacFarlane said. ""Many students lacked formal education programs, and many staff had other income already dramatically impacted. This seemed like a perfect solution in trying to solve the problem of keeping students and staff engaged and continuing to work together on skill development.""</p>  <p>Knowing how much the performance aspect was important to both the students and their audience, the Colts also developed a plan to create virtual performances.</p>  <p>""It‚Äôs not quite the same as performing in person with each other, but we are still able to accomplish our goal of creating a musical experience for an audience,"" Miller said.</p>  <p>The Colts have released two ensemble performances to date. In their homes, the students record themselves playing their part, and then the staff combines those recordings into a cohesive product. The first two productions were titled, ""Virtual Strangers,"" based on the melody ‚ÄúStranger in Paradise,"" and ""Virtual Anthem,"" an arrangement of ‚ÄúThe Star Spangled Banner"" which was introduced Memorial Day weekend. Currently, the Colts are working on their next project, scheduled to be released on July 4.</p>  <p>""The need for arts programs, artistic development, and a confidence- and character-building framework continues despite a halt of social gatherings,"" MacFarlane said. ""In fact, as people look for different and more at home entertainment, this need has seemed even more critical than normal.""</p>  <p>Overall, Miller and MacFarlane said they believe the development of <i>Colts Homeroom</i> was a great investment for everyone involved.</p>  <p>""We‚Äôve all learned a great deal through this process,"" Miller said. ""They say necessity is the mother of invention, and I would say that we have completely reinvented how we approach the drum corps activity. It has been a blessing to have the opportunity to spread some positivity in a time of so much negativity.""</p>  <p>""We could have locked the doors and shut down,"" MacFarlane said, ""and it might have saved money ‚Äî but does that mean our young people are okay without our services?

The health and safety of our members, staff and volunteers is at the top of everyone‚Äôs priority list, and the spread of COVID-19 appears as if it will impact many parts of the country into the summer months. </p>  <p>At the same time, the Voting Membership adopted an exception to the DCI rules regarding age of eligibility. The exception states, ‚ÄúAny member whose last year of eligibility was the 2020 season shall be eligible to compete in the 2021 season.‚Äù</p>  <p>For the Colts, we are planning to offer alternative approaches to engage our students in a virtual drum corps experience throughout the summer with lessons on music, movement, and physical fitness routines that will put us in great shape to, literally, hit the ground running as preparations begin for the 2021 season.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm saddened by the inevitable disruption to our activity, I know my disappointment pales in comparison to that of our students and staff who have been working so hard but now have to wait to see their work come to fruition,‚Äù said Colts Board President Jim Johnson. ‚ÄúThe Colts staff and our Board of Directors remain mission-focused and will continue our practices of doing what‚Äôs right and putting people first.‚Äù</p>  <p>Another disappointing piece of the COVID-19 puzzle is not having the opportunity to welcome thousands of drum corps fans to our four ‚Äúhome‚Äù shows in Dubuque, Ankeny, Olathe and Cedar Rapids. Those who purchased tickets to any of our shows, or who purchased tickets to the DCI World Championships via the Colts website, will be contacted in the next week or so regarding refunds.</p>  <p>Additional details specific to the members of each corps will be coming soon from their respective corps directors ‚Äî Vicki (Colts) and Rich (Colt Cadets).</p>  <p>Ongoing plans for the summer include an announcement of the Colts Hall of Fame Class of 2020. With the time you are spending at home social distancing, please consider all the wonderful staff members, volunteers or fellow members you marched with and submit a nomination before the May 15 deadline. Information about the Colts Hall of Fame and a link to nominations details are <a href=""/2020_317"">available on our website</a> . The Class of 2020 will be announced this summer, and formally introduced at the 2021 Music On The March in Dubuque.</p>  <p>‚ÄúI believe there is an even greater future for the Colts on the other side of this,‚Äù said Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. ‚ÄúNavigating the days and months ahead is certainly going to present significant challenges, but I have faith that our fans, alumni, supporters, members, and the Dubuque community will provide the strength needed to continue this character-building, life-changing experience for decades to come.‚Äù</p>  <p><span class='hashtag'>#HoldOnToMorning</span> <span class='hashtag'>#MarchOn</span></p>"

312,2020,2,18,Colts Collaborate With Dubuque Middle School Band,"<img src=""/img/news/miller_roosevelt_clinic.jpg"" height="""" width=""100%"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>As the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps spent last weekend preparing for their summer season, members of their staff made time to help a local band prepare for its upcoming concert and contest.</p>  <p>Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane reached out to Eleanor Roosevelt Middle School about rehearsal space for Feb. 14-16. What first appeared to be a conflict quickly turned into an opportunity to coordinate a clinic for Dan Norman's 7th/8th grade band.</p>  <p>""I was looking at the district calendar and realized they had a band event that day,"" MacFarlane said. ""I was curious what they were up to, so I reached out to Mr. Norman, and it seemed like a prime opportunity to combine our forces.""</p>  <p>During Saturday morning, Rich Waddington worked with the band on two of their concert selections. Prior to taking on his role as director of the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps, Waddington taught bands at Bondurant-Farrar High School and Oskaloosa High School for more than 18 years.</p>  <p>""We worked on quite a few different concepts, including tone production and singing their parts,"" Waddington said. ""They were flexible with a different seating arrangement, and they took it all in stride. They're one of the best-sounding middle school bands I've ever been around..""</p>  <p>After the ERMS students ate lunch with Colts members, David Abrams warmed the band back up with breathing exercises and techniques. Abrams is a Breathing Gym specialist, and he spends his time outside of the Colts teaching low brass students and marching bands.</p>  <p>Next, Colts Brass Arranger Michael Miller led the ERMS band through rehearsal of one of his original compositions, which the band is preparing for contest in March. </p>  <p>""Music, to me, has always been about making personal connections,"" Miller said. ""The reason I do music is because I was inspired at a young age by my teachers. I specifically enjoy being that person for the next generation of student musicians.""</p>  <p>Norman said he usually hosts a clinic once a year to provide students with other perspectives before band contest. Waddington and Miller said they appreciated the students' attentiveness throughout the day.</p>  <p>""The students were really engaged and enthusiastic,"" Miller said. ""Sometimes you work with students and they can be more closed off to strangers, but these kids were really receptive.""</p>  <p>Overall, Norman said the event was a success, and he appreciated the work the clinicians put in.</p>  <p>""They put high expectations on the kids, and they did so in a very positive way,"" Norman said. ""I enjoy watching good clinicians, and I got a lot out of it, too. It was one of the highlights of my career.""</p>  <p>After the middle school students finished their day, they had the opportunity to watch the Colts rehearse.</p>  <p>""I think it's especially beneficial for the middle school students to watch rehearsal because our members aren't that much older than them,"" Miller said. ""I think they can relate to our members, and because of that, they can get some inspiration from seeing their peers achieve a much higher level of performance.""</p>  <p>Norman said he appreciates having a resource like the Colts in the community.</p>  <p>""I've known the Colts since 1993,"" Norman said. ""People are always polite, willing to help and willing to go out of their way for other people. There are things that are landmark for communities, and I think the Colts are a positive part of Dubuque.""</p>  <p>The ERMS band will perform in concert on March 3 at 7 p.m., and they will host the Northeastern Iowa Bandmasters Association Middle School Large Group Festival on March 5.</p>  <p>The Colts will continue their season in April with a three-day rehearsal at Stephen Hempstead High School. The Colt Cadets will host an open house rehearsal on Sunday, February 23 from 1-5 p.m. at Table Mound Elementary School.

She‚Äôs involved in the university‚Äôs flagship choral ensemble, University Singers, and is a member of the sorority Alpha Phi.</p>   <p>Alayna first experienced drum corps in 2011 after attending a show in her hometown of Waukee, Iowa. She continued attending the show each year through high school, where she played trombone in the marching band before serving as drum major as a junior and senior.</p>   <p>During her senior year of high school, Alayna started to think about participating in a drum corps.</p>  <p>""I knew a couple people from my high school who auditioned with the Colts before,"" Alayna said. ""My school had us participate in a DCI drum major camp, and that opened my eyes to what drum corps is. Getting to see a full rehearsal day, it seemed like an exciting challenge.""</p>  <p>Alayna auditioned and earned a spot with the Colts on baritone for the 2018 season. In 2019, she returned in the baritone section, and she also played bass trombone in the trombone quintet.</p>  <p>When asked to serve as drum major for the Colts, Alayna said she appreciated the opportunity.</p>  <p>""I looked up to the previous drum majors, and I‚Äôm excited to take what they set up and continue developing the legacy the Colts have been building for the last couple years,"" Alayna said.</p>  <p>Vicki MacFarlane, director of the Colts, said she‚Äôs looking forward to continuing to work with Alayna.</p>  <p>""Alayna‚Äôs allegiance to the organization is huge, and it‚Äôs something we value at the Colts,"" Vicki said. ""We have a lot of mixed meter in this show, and it takes some advanced capabilities to handle it. Alayna‚Äôs camaraderie with her peers, her leadership, and her conducting skills make her a tremendously valuable asset to the organization and the 2020 Colts.

Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs.

You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude, or excerpt you feel comfortable with. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group.<br>  <br>  Color Guard: Bring black lightweight workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans), black pants or shorts, and a black shirt for Sunday's performance, your own rifle and/or sabre (if you would like), and knee pads (recommended). There is no need to purchase any special equipment for rehearsals. You will wear your audition t-shirt for most rehearsal segments through the weekend. <br>  <br>  Percussion: Bring your own sticks or mallets and your practice pad.

If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href=""/rsvp"">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br> <br> If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us.

Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p> 				<br>  <p><b>PRE-TOUR MEDICAL AND AUDIOLOGY SCREENINGS</b></p>  Dr. Steve Rock (MD) and Dr. Dee Higgins (PhD) will have a team of athletic training students from Clarke University offering pre-emptive orthopaedic screeinings at no charge as a service to you. <i>Please note: this is primarily for color guard auditionees and veteran members. Dr. Higgins' team will be back at later camps.</i> You need to be 18 or older, or have an adult present if you are 17 or younger. There will be a small questionnaire to complete (<a href=""/documents/medical_prescreening_page_1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">available online here</a> to fill out in advance if you'd like) and then they will do some joint or flexibility tests. If you have any questions or concerns about your physical health prior to tour, these concerns can be addressed with Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins at the camp. Please wear athletic clothing as you would for rehearsal. You can <a href=""/2019_news#267"" target=""_blank"">click here to read more</a> about our partnership with Clarke University.</p>  <p><b>These screenings are NOT your pre-tour physical and this is NOT your medical history form.</b> It's a supplemental service that we are very fortunate to be able to provide. This is to help you prepare to have a healthy and successful season and is an orthopaedic and flexibility screening, which helps you prepare for tour, while also helping train future athletic trainers. We have learned 80% of physical issues that can arise during a drum corps season are pre-existing conditions that can be addressed readily and safely at this time of year. Screenings will be in the main lobby of the Five Flags Center. You may complete your screening after you have checked in for the camp.</p>  <p>Following your medical screening, we will have an audiologist on site who will be doing hearing screenings at no charge as a service for you. If you are interested in having your hearing screened, the athletic trainers will be able to direct you to the screening room following your orthopedic screening. We will have more details on this soon!</p>  <br>  <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>  An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 PM Bring all of your questions!

The corps continued with their new tour model adopted last year, spending more time ""on the road"" during the season.</p>  <p>The organization as a whole also had many successes throughout the season. A large focus this year was the <a href=""/documents/2020vision.pdf"" target=""_blank"">20/20 Vision Capital Campaign</a>. Through the support of hundreds of incredible supporters, the Colts were able to travel this season with two new semi trailers on the road. The equipment trailer was a brand new, 2019 Kentucky trailer. The kitchen trailer was a new-to-us 2008 Kentucky trailer. Both trailers had a huge and positive impact on the day to day lives and efficiency of the members, staff, and volunteers. Thank you to all who donated and helped with construction ‚Äî this project couldn't have happened without you!</p>  <p>This year, the Colts were also able to induct four individuals into the Hall Of Fame. This year's inductees were recognized at a ceremony during the intermission of Music On The March. Membership in the Hall Of Fame is the highest honor the organization can give, and recognizes those whose history of outstanding contributions to the Colts has played a significant and long-term role in our organization and in the marching arts. <a href=""/2019_282"" target=""_blank"">You can read about this year's Hall Of Fame inductees here.</a> This year's class was also joined by the 2018 class, whose ceremony in last summer was unfortunately cancelled due to weather.</p>  <p>Of course, this season, and this activity, could not have happened without the help, dedication, passion, and love from our many parents and volunteers. A huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to anyone and everyone who helped throughout the season, whether cooking, driving, sewing uniforms, or anything else that helps both drum corps move down the road. The Colts and Colt Cadets appreciate you so much and cannot thank you enough. Similarly, a huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to all of the incredible donors, sponsors, and endorsers who continue to believe in and support the mission of the Colts Youth Organization.</p>  <p>The next few weeks will be a time to relax, reflect, and unpack from this season, but things are already moving into place for 2020. This season allowed the organization to connect with its alumni and history in new ways, while also setting the stage for the next year of excellence.

2825,2019,7,21,Colts Continue As Iowa Arts Council Cultural Leadership Partner With FY2020 Operating Support Grant,"<p>The Colts Youth Organization was recently honored to receive a Cultural Leadership Partner Operating Support Grant from the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. The organization received a grant award of $20,000. This is the second year of a three-year grant cycle.</p> 				<p>Cultural Leadership Partners demonstrate their investment in a rich cultural environment that improves the quality of life for all Iowans. Partners are selected every three years and receive grant funds to support operating costs throughout the three-year cycle. The Colts were selected because of their exemplary record of programming, managerial excellence and community service on a year-round basis to the citizens of Iowa.</p> 				<p>‚ÄúIowa is becoming known as a culturally vibrant state with world-class arts and cultural offerings, where engaging experiences revitalize communities with unique characteristics and local charm,‚Äù said Chris Kramer, director of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. ""These projects represent Iowa as a place that values the creative sector as an economic driver, contributing to a productive business climate and a diversified economy.""</p> 				<p>Research shows that investments in arts and culture ‚Äî in museums, performances and historic buildings, for example ‚Äî help communities boost tourism, attract businesses, retain workers and improve the overall quality of life for residents. Accordingly, the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs helps Iowans invest in the people, places and points of pride that define our state.</p> 				<p>The Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs announced in late June that it has awarded more than $2.1 million in grants for art, film, history and culture. The state agency also designated or redesignated 22 communities as Iowa Great Places or Cultural and Entertainment Districts.</p> 				<p>Colts programs serve young people who desire high levels of challenge, achievement and success and they carry an expectation that members are committed to hard work and dedication. The organization has been in continuous existence since their founding in 1963. The Colts are proud to represent Iowans across the country each summer as ""Iowa's Ambassadors of Music.""</p>"

You can bring the paperwork with you when you move in or email it ahead of time to <a href=""mailto:colts@colts.org"">colts@colts.org</a>.  <uL>  <li><a href=""/documents/MemberHandbook_2019.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Member Handbook</a> acknowledgment</li>  <li><a href=""/documents/CarWash_2019.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Car Wash</a> sponsor sheet with at least $175 in donations secured</li>  <li><a href=""/documents/MedicalForm2019.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Medical Form</a>, <a href=""/documents/PhysicalForm2019.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Physical Form</a>, vaccination record, and a copy of health insurance card (front and back)</li>  <li>Proof of age </li>  <li>Summer tour fees paid in full (you can <a href=""https://store.colts.org/products/colts-summer-member-fees"" target=""_blank"">pay online here</a>)</li>  </uL>  </p>  <br>  <p><b>CAR PARKING OVER SUMMER</b><br>  If you are driving your car, you will park it for the weekend at Roosevelt, and then take it to the corps hall prior to us leaving the school Monday morning for the parade. Your car will be kept throughout the summer at our vehicle lot at the corps hall. The lot is not secured. We prefer that you do not leave a car in Dubuque for the summer. If you have no other alternative, contact Jason at <a href=""mailto:jason@colts.org"">jason@colts.org</a> in advance. Only leave your car in Dubuque if absolutely essential. <i>Although we do our best to keep everything safe, the Colts accept no responsibility for vehicles left in Dubuque</i>.</p>  <br>  <p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br>  These parts were included in your contract payments and will be handed out at Move Ins. Each brass and battery member receives a member shirt and marching shoes (brass, cymbals, and DM also receive gloves). Guard members receive shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag, and other necessary personal items.</p>  <br>  <p><b>CAR WASH: JUNE 8, 2019</b><br>  This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>  <p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 8.</p>  <p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $50,000 in our one-day event! It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas, and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones. The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p>  <p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge will end up being around $7.50. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received. We collect these payments through the office by mail or online. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5.00. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p>  <p>For donations and pledges collected and turned in prior at move ins, members who collect and turn in $225 or more will receive a $25 gift card to the souvie stand. Members who collect and turn in $300 or more will get a $50 gift card to the souvie stand.</p>  <br>  <p><b>DCI WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS HOTEL & TICKETS</b><br>  Finals Week is August 8 - 10 in Indianapolis, Indiana. There are still great seats and great rooms available for the best week of the summer! The Colts WILL perform August 8 and 9, but are not guaranteed a spot in finals on August 10. Plan accordingly. We have seats available for all three shows. You can purchase your tickets online at the <a href=""https://store.colts.org/products/dci-world-championships-tickets"" target=""_blank"">Colts Mall</a>.

The Colts will exclusively wear Fruhauf uniforms, becoming the third Drum Corps International World Class corps to do so. The Fruhauf team will work closely with the Colts design team to bring a unique and memorable uniform to the field every year, made possible by the unparalleled Fruhauf level of service. The Colt Cadets will begin wearing Fruhauf uniforms in 2020, becoming the first Open Class corps to do so. <a href=""https://fruhauf.com"" target=""_blank"">Click here to learn more about Fruhauf Uniforms.</a></p>  <p>""From our very first meeting with the Fruhauf team ‚Äî Richard, Kenny, and Landon ‚Äî we felt immediately at home,‚Äù said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. ‚ÄúTo be honest, their history and legacy in the uniform industry was a bit of a surprise to me. But their vision for creating pieces that work in tandem with the corps program designers feels very fresh to me. The move to Fruhauf opens up an opportunity for the Colts to begin a new era in our long, drum corps history.‚Äù</p>  <p>""I am ecstatic about our partnership with Fruhauf!"" said Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane. ""While I have always admired their work, their attention to detail and care of employees stood out to me on our initial visit. Their capability and capacity to fulfill visions in-house is amazing and uncommon. Their designers have an ability to combine modern methods with traditional looks; every experience is one of a kind. We look forward to an incredible partnership that ultimately benefits each and every member that wears the Fruhauf name.""</p>  <p>‚ÄúOn behalf of the entire Fruhauf family, we could not be more excited about partnering with an organization who is dedicated to life on the field, excellence in music education, and an unwavering passion for the arts. We are proud to welcome the Colts to the Fruhauf Family!‚Äù</p>"

271,2019,3,7,Drum Corps Returns To Ankeny In 2019,"<img src=""/img/news/CIB_Ankeny.jpg"" height="""" width=""250"" alt=""Celebration In Brass 2019"" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>In 2019, the annual drum corps show <i>Celebration In Brass</i> will return to Ankeny, Iowa. The show has its historic roots in Ankeny, with the first drum corps performance in the town taking place in 1982. Ankeny hosted the event for over 25 years, where the show became a staple summer event for drum corps fans in the Des Moines area. In 2019, the Colts are partnering with the <a href=""https://ankenybands.com/ankeny-instrumental-music-foundation/"" target=""_blank"">Ankeny Instrumental Music Foundation</a> to host the show. Established in 1999, the foundation supports the band programs in both Ankeny High School and Ankeny Centennial High School.</p>  <p>Brandt Crocker, DCI Hall of Famer and ""The Voice Of DCI"" since 1972, has been with <i>Celebration In Brass</i> since its first year.</p>  <p>""The show really had a small beginning,"" said Brandt. ""There was a guy in town who ran a tire shop and, someway or another, he knew about drum corps. He happened to also be on the Ankeny Area Chamber Of Commerce and brought the idea of hosting a drum corps show to the Chamber in the fall of 1981. The Chamber then approached DCI and started setting everything up. Shortly after the contract was signed, I got a call from the DCI office asking me to work with the Chamber to make sure everything went well.""</p>  <p>""With all the prep work completed, we were all ready for what looked like was going to be a great event. I was there to announce the show and oversee the day-of operations. Unfortunately, the weather had other plans. The first year was dominated by storms and a mini-tornado that blew through the north end zone of the stadium. In those days, we didn't have any real weather policies, so we kept moving the crowd between the school's gym and the stadium, hoping to have the show go on. Eventually, we called the show, with only one corps being able to perform. However, a spark had been lit within the Chamber, and they were committed to the idea of hosting a drum corps show. We came back next year and had perfect weather. Over the years, the show developed a massive following in the community and we generally had around 3,500 people in the stands. The community loved the drum corps activity and loved seeing the performances every summer. The corps always enjoyed coming to Ankeny as well ‚Äî we had some great housing sites and the crowd response was always top-notch.""</p>  &nbsp;  <p>A couple years after the Ankeny Chamber dropped out due to a change in the DCI tour schedule, the Colts brought a show back to the Des Moines metro. Originally named <i>Summer Showdown</i> to tie into the fall marching band festival at West Des Moines Valley High School, the event was held for two years in Valley Stadium before moving to Waukee. In 2011, the regular DCI tour stop resumed the long-standing name <i>Celebration In Brass</i> in partnership with the Waukee Band Boosters. <i>Celebration In Brass</i> then moved to Johnston High School in 2017 due to a stadium conflict in Waukee, and now this year the long-overdue return to Ankeny.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to have an opportunity to reunite with Ankeny for <i>Celebration In Brass</i>,‚Äù said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. ""The school district has been fully supportive ‚Äî from the superintendent and facilities people to the band directors ‚Äî everyone is excited to see if we can rekindle the magic of drum corps in Ankeny. I remember coming here in 2004 when my son marched in Colt Cadets, and while the setting will be familiar, the stadium has been completely remodeled and will provide a perfect setting for a good ol‚Äô Midwest drum corps show. Not to mention, the corps line up is fantastic.‚Äù</p>  &nbsp;  <p>Christian Baughman, Colts alumnus and instrumental music instructor for Ankeny Community Schools, is working closely with the Colts and the Ankeny Instrumental Music Foundation to coordinate the show.</p>  <p>""30 years ago, in the summer of 1989, my high school ‚Äòband buddy‚Äô picked up an incoming freshman who knew nothing about drum corps, let alone marching band, and brought me to <i>Celebration In Brass</i>,"" said Christian. ""That experience put me on a path that would eventually lead me to join the Colts in the summer of 1991. The following school year, I had an English teacher who shared my passion for music, the trumpet, and drum and bugle corps. I went on to become the drum major of the Colts, major in music education, and become a band director. Eleven years ago, I joined the band staff in Ankeny and three years later my former English teacher, Dr. Bruce Kimpston, became our superintendent. Like so many others in our community, we have both been eagerly anticipating the return of <i>Celebration In Brass</i> to Ankeny.""</p> 				<p>""I know that somewhere in that crowd this July there will be another kid who will be just as awestruck as I was that night all those years ago. That kid will end up following a dream that was ignited by the power, precision, and excellence that is competitive drum and bugle corps. This kid‚Äôs experiences may be repeated hundreds of times, and in this way the show will further the Ankeny Instrumental Music Foundation‚Äôs goal to elevate the skills and knowledge of every student musician to the highest level possible. I could not be more proud to help present this event with the cooperation of the AIM Foundation, the Ankeny Community Schools, and the Colts. These organizations are all world class in their own right. The audience and participating corps are in for a very special event on July 10!""</p>  &nbsp;  <p>""For 2019, I'm very happy the show is back in Ankeny,"" said Brandt. ""The community here still remembers the event, so I'm sure they'll be very excited to have drum corps back in their town as well. The renovated Ankeny Stadium will be great for the show ‚Äî there's now a turf field and the stands now face east, so the setting sun won't be in everyone's eyes. I'm looking forward to being the contest coordinator for the great line up at <i>Celebration In Brass</i> this year.""</p>  &nbsp;  <p><i>Celebration In Brass</i> will be held on Wednesday, July 10, at Ankeny Stadium At Northview Middle School. This year‚Äôs show features eight corps in DCI competition. In addition to the hosts Colts and Colt Cadets, <i>Celebration In Brass</i> is thrilled to welcome the 2018 World Class Champion Santa Clara Vanguard from Santa Clara, CA; the 2016 World Class Champion Bluecoats from Canton, OH; last year‚Äôs first-time DCI Finalist Mandarins from Sacramento, CA; as well as the Blue Stars from La Crosse, WI; The Academy from Tempe, AZ; and River City Rhythm from Anoka, MN. <b><a href=""https://store.colts.org/products/celebration-in-brass-tickets"" target=""_blank"">Tickets are available for purchase online!</a></b> Tickets are assigned according to the date/time orders are received.

267,2019,1,19,Colts Continue Strong Partnership With Clarke University & Medical Associates,"<img src=""/img/news/logo_clarke.jpg"" height="""" width=""250"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>A few snowflakes were starting to fall outside on Friday night as students finished unloading the equipment trailer. Inside Five Flags Center, the main lobby was packed with students and parents checking in for the camp weekend on one end, and athletic training students from Clarke University on the other. The athletic training students gathered together to go over a few last minute details with <b>Dr. Dee Higgins, PhD,</b> director of the Clarke University Athletic Training Program, before splitting up and making themselves available for Colts students. Now in its sixth year, this unique partnership with Clarke University allows Colts students the opportunity to have a full orthopedic and flexibility screening prior to the season, while also providing valuable hands-on experience for the students from Clarke.</p>  <p>""The orthopedic and flexibility screenings we're able to provide for the Colts can do so much to help the students have a successful season,"" said Dr. Higgins. ""Having the opportunity to sit with someone trained in athletic training and a greater understanding of how the body works in sports allows them to ask questions and receive feedback they may not get otherwise. For Clarke students, it's great exposure to the marching arts, while also providing them hands-on experience that is so crucial for future professionals in the athletic training field.""</p>  <img src=""/img/news/MA_Logo.jpg"" height="""" width=""330"" alt="""" class=""alignright imageborder"">  <p>Also on site Friday night was <b>Dr. Steve Rock, MD,</b> a member of Medical Associates Orthopedic & Sports Medicine department. Dr. Rock is the forefront expert on concussions in the performing arts and works closely with <a href=""http://athletesandthearts.com"" target=""_blank"">Athletes and the Arts</a> to bring the world of marching arts and sports medicine together. In collaboration with Athletes and the Arts, Dr. Rock recently wrote a chapter in ""Performing Arts Medicine"" by Lauren E. Elson (Elsevier Publishers) titled, <i>Care of the Marching Musician</i>.</p>  <p>""We've learned that about 80% of physical issues which may arise during a drum corps season are pre-exisiting conditions we can address readily and safely this time of year,"" said Dr. Rock. ""By providing the Colts this one-on-one time with athletic trainers, we are able to identify potential issues with the time to react and assure a successful season. This gives everyone time to create plans for issues that may arise over the season, allowing the student to arrive at move ins as prepared and healthy as possible.""</p>  <p>Dr. Higgins and Dr. Rock have been involved with the Colts organization since 2009, providing resources, feedback, and ideas to the Colts and Colt Cadets students and staff on a wide variety of scenarios that may arise in a drum corps season. In 2016, Colts added an athletic trainer to the tour staff, and in 2017 Colt Cadets added a health and wellness coordinator to the tour staff. These staff members, along with Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane and Colt Cadets Director Andrew Eaton, communicate regularly with Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins about the various needs of students while on tour. In 2014, the Colts received a grant from Medical Associates Foundation to fund a three-year medical research project to study the effects of the drum corps activity on students. This study provided information on the physical demands students experience during a season of drum corps, allowing Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins to target their efforts to where students need them most. This study also heightened the Colts awareness of the caloric intake of students, leading to a restructuring of the food program for both corps to help provide sufficient calories to stay healthy throughout a drum corps season. <a href=""/2014_news#93"" target=""_blank"">Read more about this grant and study here</a>.</p>  <p>""Our partnership with Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins has been a game-changer for the experience of our members,"" said Vicki MacFarlane. ""It's taken several seasons to build the level of awareness and trust we have, but we are very proud of where we are as an organization now. Seeing first-hand the success stories of our students who have finished their seasons has been wonderful. Everything is a work in progress, and our ultimate goal is to just be better today than the we were the day before.""</p>  <p>Last September, Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins presented to all World Class drum corps directors at the annual <a href=""https://www.dci.org/news/comprehensive-strategic-systemic-performer-and-organizational-wellness-is-central-focus-at-fall-meeting-of-dci-organizations"" target=""_blank"">Drum Corps International September Meeting</a> in Phoenix. Their presentation and discussions with the voting membership helped lay the groundwork for the <a href=""https://www.dci.org/news/dci-will-focus-on-health-wellness-and-safety-aspects-of-all-activities-during-upcoming-organization-wide-annual-meeting"" target=""_blank"">Here‚Äôs to Our Health: Drum Corps International‚Äôs 2019 Annual Meetings and Activity-Wide Health, Wellness & Safety Summit</a> that took place in January in Indianapolis. In April, when the color guard and percussion students from Texas join the corps in Dubuque, Dr. Higgins, Dr. Rock, and the Clarke University athletic training students will again be on site to provide orthopedic and flexibility screenings for Colts students.</p>  <p>Returning for her second year as athletic trainer for the Colts will be <b>Jennifer Pohlman, LAT, ATC</b>. Jen is a graduate of Clarke University and helped with several years of the Colts orthopedic screenings before signing on for a full season with the corps. ""My first season as athletic trainer with the Colts was a phenomenal experience,"" said Jen. ""Being able to graduate and then jump right into my profession, while still working closely with Dr. Higgins, has given me such a strong foundation. Every day brought something new while on tour, but all the students and staff were so fun and easy going, and it made my job so enjoyable. I'm very excited to be back in 2019 with the corps."" <a href=""/people-staff-colts#tour"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a> to read Jen's full bio.</p>  <p>‚ÄúWe love being able to showcase the strong medical and athletic training communities we have in Dubuque,‚Äù said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. ‚ÄúAt our rehearsal weekends, we welcome parents and students from around the country, and even overseas, so having all our guests see first-hand the connectivity we have to the greater Dubuque community no doubt benefits the Colts, but also shines a light on Clarke University and Medical Associates. We‚Äôve had Colts or Colt Cadets alumni who have been, or currently are, students with Dr. Higgins so seeing them interact with the organization in a new way has brought a new perspective to the Colts, as well as the classroom at Clarke. Working with Medical Associates, especially through the grant we received from them in 2014, has allowed us to really standardize and formalize a lot of what we do at the Colts, while also providing data and information to their doctors on this unique athletic and performing arts activity.‚Äù</p>"

Now that summer is done, finishing touches can be added and the project will wrap up this off-season. This spring, the Colts received a Cultural Leadership Partner Operating Support Grant from the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. The organization received the maximum allowable grant award of $20,000 per year. Read more about the Cultural Leadership grant <a href=""/2018_244"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. June and July featured several great events organized by the Alumni Steering Committee that brought together alumni to celebrate the corps 55th anniversary season. These included a social gathering after Summer Premiere and a tailgate before the home show, Music On The March. Vicki MacFarlane, Colts Director, was recognized with two awards for her service and dedication to the Colts and the drum corps activity. In April, she was recognized by the Women‚Äôs Leadership Network of Dubuque with a <a href=""/2018_231"" target=""_blank"">Women Of Achievement Award</a>. During DCI World Championships, she was the recipient of the <a href=""/2018_246"" target=""_blank"">George Bonfiglio Chairperson‚Äôs Award</a>. Also at the DCI World Championships, the Colts-sponsored event Tournament of Drums, held annually in early August in Cedar Rapids, was recognized as Open Class Event Of The Year for the third year in a row. Finally, the Colts inducted eight new individuals to the Colts Hall Of Fame.

A huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to anyone and everyone who helped throughout the season, whether cooking, driving, sewing uniforms, or anything else that helps both drum corps move down the road. The Colts and Colt Cadets appreciate you so much and cannot thank you enough. Similarly, a huge <b>THANK YOU</b> to all of the incredible donors, sponsors, and endorsers who continue to believe in and support the mission of the Colts Youth Organization.</p>  <p>The next few weeks will be a time to relax, reflect, and unpack from this season, but things are already moving into place for 2019.

246,2018,8,13,Colts Director Recognized With George Bonfiglio Award,"<img src=""/img/news/vmac_bonfiglio.jpg"" width=""250"" height="""" alt=""Bonfiglio Award"" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>At this year's Drum Corps International World Championships, Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane was recognized with the George Bonfiglio Chairperson‚Äôs Award. Now in its seventh year of being awarded, the Bonfiglio award is given annually to a person who has demonstrated extraordinary leadership, service, and effort on behalf of Drum Corps International. The recipient of the award is selected by the chair of the DCI Board of Directors, Kathy Black, and the DCI Executive Director, Dan Acheson.</p>  <p>""What a mix of emotions! I am beyond honored, humbled, proud, and appreciative ... all those sorts of feelings,"" said Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane. ""It's always great to have the Colts in the headlines, and this award is particularly special coming off such a fantastic season. This was by far my favorite summer to date, and I look forward to many more! An extra thanks to Kathy Black and Dan Acheson, who are amazing leaders in our activity.""</p>  <p>Vicki was a member of the Colts in 1994 and 1995 as a baritone player. After a few years teaching band in eastern Iowa, Vicki began volunteering with the Colts. This led to a teaching position with Colt Cadets in 2001, and then being asked to be the Colt Cadets director for the 2002 season. The corps in 2001 had 18 members, but by 2012 had over 75 members and was a perennial Open Class finalist. While director of Colt Cadets, Vicki also served as chair of Drum Corps International‚Äôs Open Class Advisory Committee for several years. For the 2013 season, Vicki became the director of the Colts, and just finished her sixth season as director. In addition, she serves as director of youth programs for the Colts Youth Organization and is a member of the <a href=""https://www.dci.org/news/dci-launches-in-step-women-in-dci-initiative"" target=""_blank"">IN STEP: Women In DCI</a> initiative. Vicki is currently the only female World Class corps director.</p>  <p>""I admire Vicki's focus on education, and her prior service as Open Class liaison demonstrated her commitment to nurture and grow the activity,"" said DCI Board Chair Kathy Black. ""As the only woman currently serving as a World Class corps director, she is a role model in the marching arts. And her energy and enthusiasm is an inspiration!""</p>  <p>George Bonfiglio was the founder and longtime director of the 27th Lancers, as well as one of the ‚Äúfounding fathers‚Äù of Drum Corps International. Bonfiglio served as the first chair of the DCI Board of Directors and was a driving force behind the growth and increased prominence of drum corps in the marching arts from the 1970s through the 2010s. Bonfiglio was inducted as part of the Drum Corps International Hall of Fame Class of 1985. You can read more about Bonfiglio and his contributions to the drum corps activity <a href=""https://www.dci.org/static/george-bonfiglio-dci-hall-of-fame"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>  <p>Tom Lizotte, long time staff member for both Colts and Colt Cadets, worked with George Bonfiglio at the 27th Lancers in the 1980s. He was a close friend of Bonfiglio's, and is a close friend and mentor of Vicki's. He has been involved in the drum corps activity since 1977 and has seen many transformations in the leadership in the activity.</p>   <p>""It is totally appropriate that Vicki be given the Bonfiglio award, in that they share many important qualities,"" Tom said. ""Their personal styles are very different, but they both are passionate, achievement-driven people who value family and drum corps as an extended family. They understand the human element of the activity. Both are can-do people for whom no task is too small. I have vivid memories of George digging into an engine at one of the Lancers' (frequent) bus breakdowns, and a usual sight is Vicki pitching in hauling props or doing whatever is necessary to renovate the corps hall. Both have high expectations and support good teaching. This award being given to Vicki is also appropriate given a bit of Lancer history. In 1986, I was brass caption head. I wanted to bring in a former North Star/Cadet mellophone player, Michelle Ledoux, as my head tech. With the exception of Sandra Opie, female brass instructors didn't exist back then in drum corps. Bonfiglio was all for us bringing Michelle on board, and he strongly supported her work. It was visionary and smart. When it came time to speak to the horn line before the performance we knew deep down would be the corps' last-ever, he deferred to Michelle. The path to recognition for women in this activity has been too long and too slow. George Bonfiglio was an early leader in hiring Michelle and making his daughter Denise program coordinator, and Vicki is carrying that torch. Very ftting.""</p>"

244,2018,8,5,Colts Receive Grant From Iowa Department Of Cultural Affairs,"<p>The Colts Youth Organization was recently honored to receive a Cultural Leadership Partner Operating Support Grant from the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. The organization received the maximum allowable grant award of $20,000 per year.</p> 				<p>Cultural Leadership Partners demonstrate their investment in a rich cultural environment that improves the quality of life for all Iowans. Partners are selected every three years and receive grant funds to support operating costs throughout the three-year cycle. The Colts were selected because of their exemplary record of programming, managerial excellence and community service on a year-round basis to the citizens of Iowa.</p> 				<p>""These grants are catalysts that can spark cultural and economic growth in historic downtowns, concert halls and, possibly, the studio of a future Grant Wood,"" said Chris Kramer, acting director of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs. ""We're proud to help Iowans make our state a culturally vibrant place to live, work and play.""</p> 				<p>Research shows that investments in arts and culture -- in museums, performances and historic buildings, for example -- help communities boost tourism, attract businesses, retain workers and improve the overall quality of life for residents. Accordingly, the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs helps Iowans invest in the people, places and points of pride that define our state.</p> 				<p>For the new fiscal year that started July 1, the department awarded a total of $2,091,162 in 210 grants through two of its divisions -- the Iowa Arts Council and the State Historical Society of Iowa. The Iowa Arts Council awarded a total of $1,403,265. Grants ranging from $10,000 to $20,000 were awarded to 43 Cultural Leadership Partners -- anchor organizations across the state that significantly contribute to their surrounding regions.</p> 				<p>Colts programs serve young people who desire high levels of challenge, achievement and success and they carry an expectation that members are committed to hard work and dedication. The organization has been in continuous existence since their founding in 1963. The Colts are proud to represent Iowans across the country each summer as ""Iowa's Ambassadors of Music.""</p> 				<p>#iowaarts #iowaculture #iacgrantee</p> </p>"

238,2018,6,1,June Alumni Feature: Interview With Evan Saddler,"<img src=""/img/news/EvanSaddler2.jpg"" height="""" width=""500"" alt=""Evan Saddler"" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>All of us who have been through the rigors of drum corps have used the experiences we gained during our time as members to become more productive citizens. Some of us have become teachers or doctors. Some of us have become laborers or accountants or nurses. And, a few have continued on to be professional musicians. One particular alumnus is Evan Saddler. Evan grew up in Dubuque, and attended Sageville Elementary, Jefferson Middle School, and Stephen Hempstead High School.</p>  <p>At the age of eight, he began playing the saxophone, and soon after started dabbling in piano. Around the same time, he attended a Music On The March show at Dubuque Senior High School and got the ""drum corps bug."" He noticed that drum corps did not march saxophones and decided to try out for the Colt Cadets on percussion at age 13. In 2007, Evan started on marimba and vibraphone. In 2008, he played top bass drum, and during 2009, his final year with the Colt Cadets, he was on the snare line.</p>  <p>In 2010, Evan made the cut and secured a spot in the Colts front ensemble playing rack and auxiliary percussion. 2010 was Evan's only year marching World Class drum corps, but he credits the instructors from all four years with the Colts Youth Organization as fundamental in discovering his passion for music and pursing it as a career.</p>  <p>After his summer in the Colts, Evan spent his last two years of high school at the Interlochen Arts Academy in northern Michigan. After graduating in 2012, Evan was not certain if a music career was what his heart was driving him towards, and he enrolled at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. There, he began a liberal arts degree with an interest in economics and communication, while still pursuing his musical interests.</p>  <p>After his freshman year, his heart and mind nudged him towards fully pursuing a music performance degree. He transferred to the University of Michigan, after being strongly influenced by Joseph Gramley, the percussionist in the Grammy-Award winning group Silk Road Ensemble, led by cellist Yo-Yo Ma.</p>  <p>After spending three formative years in Ann Arbor, Evan's skill and drive led him to one of the coveted spots at The Juilliard School in New York City. In May 2018, he graduated from Juilliard with a Master's of Music in percussion. <b>It should be noted in the undergraduate and graduate program combined there are only 10 students.</b></p>  <p>When preparing for this article, Evan was caught by surprise that we wanted to speak to him. When he began to reflect about his time in the Colts, one could sense his humbleness. You could sense the emotions he holds from his marching days had a strong impact on him as a person and as a musician.</p>  <p>""All of the values and skills I learned in corps gave me the confidence to work and communicate with lots of different people. The Colts mission, 'We use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life,' was taught through the lessons of hard work, like the 12-hour rehearsal days in the July Texas heat, playing a show, then sleeping on buses and arriving in the wee hours of the morning in a new town so that we could do it all again the next day. We were always striving to be better, while having some fun along the way.""</p>  <p>Evan elaborated on how his days in corps have helped him today. ""Being one of the younger guys in the corps, I learned a tremendous amount from the older members who were much more musically advanced than I was. Being around people who were a lot better than me provided a great opportunity for me to grow from their experience.""</p>  <p>Evan noted, from leaving home to going to school at Interlochen to making ends meet in New York City, that drum corps has helped him deal with hardships. ""Drum corps taught me how to tackle almost any situation with a positive attitude. This has helped a lot in living in New York, where it seems that everything that can go wrong does.""</p>  <p>Evan has stated that the strongest influencers from his time with the Colts and Colt Cadets were Brian Zeglis, JJ Thomas, Ronnie LaGrone, Max Mullinix, Vicki MacFarlane, and Greg Orwoll.</p>  <p>In particular, Evan recalls during his first year in the Colt Cadets, he thought he would only march one year. However, after the Dubuque home show, Greg Orwoll spoke with the Cadets and Evan said he ""felt like I was part of something much bigger than myself, the sense of family that everyone talks about hit me."" This pushed him to march three more years with the organization.</p>  <p>While at Juilliard, Evan has not only pursued his Master's, but has been active as a music educator. He served as an instructor for middle school students in a program called the Music Advancement Program, as a mentor for high school students within the Juilliard Pre-College program, and as a teaching assistant in Juilliard's freshman Entrepreneurship course.</p>  <p>Evan is also the co-artistic director and percussionist for <a href=""https://con-duit.org"" target=""_blank"">Conduit</a>, an ensemble he brought to fruition with another student and friend from Julliard. Drawing from his drum corps days, Evan is tying together elements from music, choreography, and staging to fulfill Conduit's mission of creating performance experiences for Millennial audiences.</p>  <p>You can see Evan in Iowa this summer at <a href=""https://nisom.com/index.php/outreach/chamberfest-dubuque"" target=""_blank"">ChamberFest Dubuque</a> during the first week of June. ChamberFest was started by another Dubuquer, Juilliard graduate, and Pulitzer Prize finalist, composer Michael Gilbertson. You can also see him in August in Madison, where he will be performing at the <a href=""https://madisonnewmusic.org"" target=""_blank"">Madison New Music Festival</a> with Conduit. You can learn more about Evan Saddler at <a href=""https://www.evandsaddler.com"" target=""_blank"">evandsaddler.com</a></p>  <p>Evan also hopes to be in attendance for the alumni festivities on July 13, 2018, at Music On The March.

236,2018,5,24,Colt Cadets Announce 2018 Program,"<p>Old becoming new again is the idea behind the Colt Cadets 2018 program, <b>Moderne</b>. The approach parallels the aesthetic of Art Deco ‚Äî existing art and architecture reimagined in streamlined and futuristic fashion, or Style Moderne. In Art Deco, futuristic and abstract art forms exist juxtaposed or superimposed on traditional forms.</p>   <p>The program starts with a futuristic, jazz-flavored interpretation of ‚ÄúUn Bel Di,‚Äù the iconic theme from Puccini‚Äôs <i>Madame Butterfly</i>. Starting with <i>Madame Butterly</i>, the corps blends shapes, music, and visual aesthetics through the lens of Art Deco style. After the opener, things take an unexpected twist. The corps begins its second production with the very somber opening of the second movement from Beethoven‚Äôs <i>Symphony No. 7</i>, which suddenly flips to a rhumba ‚Äî an imagining of Beethoven on a Miami vacation.</p>  <p>By its nature, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is old meets new, evoking the era of the roaring ‚Äò20s, flappers, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Colt Cadets recall that time while performing new music written to fit the occasion, ‚ÄúYoung and Beautiful‚Äù by Lana Del Rey. Next is a variation of the Art Deco aesthetic ‚Äî new becoming old. What if Bach wrote for Lady Gaga? The result might be Colt Cadets ‚ÄúBad Romance,‚Äù which is a Bach fugue-influenced treatment of one of Lady Gaga's breakout hits.</p>  <p>If Mussorgsky wrote jazz, he might have treated his <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i> as the Colt Cadets will in ‚ÄúHut of Baba Yaga‚Äù and ‚ÄúGreat Gate of Kiev.‚Äù Combining the traditional Russian music with the expressiveness of the American jazz scene brings the program full circle as the Colt Cadets explore all the facets of Style Moderne.</p>    <p><img src=""/img/cadets2018.jpg"" height=""500"" alt=""2018 Colt Cadets Production"" class=""aligncenter imageborder""></p>    <p>The Colt Cadets will debut their 2018 production, along with the Colts, at the 8th Annual <a href=""/summerpremiere"" target=""_blank"">Colts Summer Premiere</a> on Friday, June 22, at the University of Dubuque Chalmers Field.

Guard members pay $150 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag, and other necessary personal items.</p>  <br>  <p><b>CAR WASH: JUNE 9, 2018</b><br>  This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>  <p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 9.</p>  <p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $50,000 in our one-day event! It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas, and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones. The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p>  <p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge will end up being around $7.50. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received. We collect these payments through the office by mail or online. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5.00. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p>  <p>New for 2018: For donations and pledges collected and turned in prior at move ins, members who collect $225 or more will receive a $25 gift card to the souvie stand. Members who collect and turn in $300 or more will get a $50 gift card to the souvie stand.</p>  <br>  <p><b>DCI WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS HOTEL & TICKETS</b><br>  Finals Week is August 9 - 11 in Indinapolis, Indiana.

232,2018,5,1,"May Alumni Feature: The History Of Morning""""","<p>For this month's alumni newsletter, we asked Kent Lineberry to share his experience with the corps song, ""Morning."" Kent was a member of the Colts from 1996 to 1999 as a tenor player, and was on staff from 2000 to 2005, 2007, and 2017 to 2018. The corps song holds a special place in many alumni's memories with the corps, and Kent was excited to share his memories of the piece and the story of how it became known as the corps song.</p>    <br>    <p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wf8M3o-YC9Q"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; encrypted-media"" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>    <br>    <p><b><i>Lyrics to ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù</i></b></p>  <div class=""col-xs-6"">  	<p><i>Aurora breaks with passion and glory<br>  To harken the song of sunrise,<br>  The opening eyes of everyday morning<br>  And the rose wine blush of the sun.<br>  As I hold you near in silence,<br>  I drift between my dreams and the dawn.<br>  <br>  A whirlwind of emotion<br>  takes me tumbling into dreams of you<br>  Lost inside darkness all around me.<br>  Then soft, like the sun, <br>  which sparkles with beauty,<br>  You take all the shadows away.<br>  As I hold you near in silence<br>  You are the joy of morning to me. <br>  <br>  In the stillness...<br>  In the first light of dawn I see.<br>  No more shadows, only light cradles me.<br>  I am strong again.</i></p> 				</div>    <div class=""col-xs-6"">  	<p><i>A soul that once was hungry for beauty<br>   Now rejoices with you in the morning.<br>  It's love so strong that makes me wonder<br>  Would my heart still beat on its own?<br>  As I hold you near in silence<br>  How precious is the time that we share <br>  Together<br>  <br>  Hold on...hold on to your dreams.<br>  Hold on...hold on to what morning brings.<br>  <br>  In the stillness...<br>  In the first light of dawn I see.<br>  No more shadows,<br>  Where only light carries me on.<br>  I am strong again, but I'll need you when<br>  Morning's gone again...<br>  Hold on...to morning.</i></p>  <br>  <br>  <br> 				</div>   				<p><b><i>Background of the corps and ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù</i></b></p>  <p>No matter which era you marched in, you know that the corps, known as the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps, founded in 1963 as the Junior Dukes, is one of the most special and valuable youth organizations in the United States. The organization‚Äôs mission statement is, ‚ÄúWe use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life.‚Äù This mission is achieved through a rigorous audition process where hundreds of potential members try out for a few spots and culminates in a two month long national tour.</p>  <p>The experience of marching in the corps is something that sticks with all members. Some members march only one season. Some move on to march in other corps. Some march their entire career with the corps until they ‚Äúage out,‚Äù when they become too old to compete in a Drum Corps International corps. But all members are changed in fundamental ways, grow as human beings in ways that are difficult to describe, and cherish this experience forever. It is something a person cannot be told; one can only experience the love and honor that comes with sacrificing their comfort, and sometimes literally blood, sweat, and tears, for the noble pursuit of an art form.</p>  <p>The corps did not select a corps song for many decades. It was presumably brought up many times, with many suggestions, but all I can share with you is my perspective. I was a member, on staff, or connected to the corps from basically 1996 to the present. I also gained some insight from my wife, Debbie, who marched 1991 - 1997 and also taught on staff for years.</p>  <p>In 1998, the corps played ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù as a part of their program, ‚ÄúAn A Capella Celebration.‚Äù The lyrics of this piece became very important to the corps, as this was the year they were involved in a three bus accident in Montreal, Quebec. Multiple members were rushed to the hospital with major contusions, concussions, and facial injuries from the impact. The 1998 corps quickly realized that their time together on this good Earth and as a drum corps for the summer was precious, not guaranteed, and fragile. The lyrics of this piece helped power that edition of the Colts into finals in 1998 after being a semifinalist in 1997.</p>  <p>In 1999, the Corps leadership wanted to institute ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù as the corps song. The discussion was tabled after purposeful discussions with some of the most influential staff members of that era, as this is not the sort of thing one rushes into. However, the corps began to truly and palpably feel the absence of that unifying element of their experience. They noted that other corps had a unifying corps song, and felt this was something the Colts deserved, and would soon demand. The seed was sown.</p>  <p>""Morning"" continued to be important to the members, even without being a corps song, and was often played to wake the corps on finals day, or during morning stretch to start the day. The lyrics were constantly referred to in context of the corps: sacrifice, the special bonds that are formed, and what makes the Colts special.</p>  <p>In 2005, the corps was finally allowed to choose a corps song. They were made cognizant of the fact that what they would choose would reflect on generations of Colts, and that they needed to choose with great care. However, traditions must begin somewhere, and it was decided by Corps Director Greg Orwoll that it would begin here. The members and staff were allowed to submit suggestions for review. The choices included ‚ÄúOld Man River,‚Äù ‚ÄúSummertime,‚Äù ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù and several others. All of the works considered were important to the corps in one way or another, at one time or another. Staff members ‚Äúadopted‚Äù a corps song candidate, and presented the song to the corps, with explanation for why it was a good choice. I was honored to represent ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù by Vox One to the corps.</p>  <p>Due in no part to my bumbling presentation, the membership overwhelmingly chose ""Morning"" as their corps song. It continues to this day to be special to the members and alumni that are aware of the meaning.</p>  <p>An explanation below will hopefully help alumni before 1998 understand why this work was chosen. It was chosen to honor the special experience that is being a member of the Colts. There is something that connects alumni of the corps that transcends uniforms, music selections, asymmetrical drill, and the like. It‚Äôs the shared bond of coming to Dubuque to test one‚Äôs mettle and audition for a corps, hoping for the chance to work incredibly hard all summer while your classmates from school were relaxing at home. It represents the closeness that members get by shared misery and joy, common living conditions, and uncommon brother and sisterhood. It‚Äôs pushing a bus. It‚Äôs doing four parades on the 4th of July and then doing a show, with a loud carnival going on 100 feet from the end zone. It‚Äôs helping a bloodied corps mate off a totaled bus on a Canadian superhighway. It‚Äôs connecting during the off season after the loss of a beloved member to a tragic accident. It‚Äôs the fact that when members get back together decades later, it‚Äôs as if they just walked off the field and are standing in line at the cook truck again. It‚Äôs those things that make this special, and it‚Äôs those things this corps song celebrates.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><b><i>An explanation of why ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù was chosen.</i></b></p>  <p>Again, this is my interpretation of this, and it holds slightly different meaning for each member. My intention for this is to reach out to those that came before me, and let them know why this song means so much to the corps today, and how it actually reflects the intangibles that make this corps great. It refers to our past and the connections we all share.</p>    <p><i>Aurora breaks with passion and glory<br>  To harken the song of sunrise,<br>  The opening eyes of everyday morning<br>  And the rose wine blush of the sun.<br>  As I hold you near in silence,<br>  I drift between my dreams and the dawn.</i><br>  <br>  Analysis: waking in the morning is a sacred part of drum corps. Most of the time, the drum major wakes the corps gently, to help us begin our day. The morning is different for every member, but we all share the experience of sore muscles and sun burnt skin.</p>    <br>    <p><i>A whirlwind of emotion<br>  takes me tumbling into dreams of you<br>  Lost inside darkness all around me.<br>  Then soft, like the sun,<br>  which sparkles with beauty,<br>  You take all the shadows away.<br>  As I hold you near in silence<br>  You are the joy of morning to me.</i><br>  <br>  Analysis: these lyrics remind me of the way Colts support each other, and the difficult way we are ripped apart one evening in August. Competing for what could be the last time, whether it‚Äôs Thursday night or Saturday night, is the very definition of ‚Äúa whirlwind of emotions.‚Äù I remember very clearly the feeling of darkness all around me when I was finally alone on an airplane, in my first shower at home, wherever that moment was, I felt incredible sadness that was tough to deal with. But, as we all know, all it takes is a phone call or some other communication with the people we marched with, and it is like we never left each others‚Äô sides. It truly took all the shadows away during that tough time right after tour ended.</p>    <br>    <p><i>In the stillness...<br>  In the first light of dawn I see.<br>  No more shadows, only light cradles me.<br>  I am strong again.</i><br>  <br>  Analysis: I feel like these lines remind me literally of the mornings waking up on tour. You‚Äôve achieved this amazing dream of being a member of a drum corps, you‚Äôve met these amazing friends, and sometimes I woke up wondering if it was all a dream. But there was Jeff ‚ÄúEd‚Äù Caswell, or Jason ‚ÄúAnkle‚Äù Long, or even my own brother Matt there on the gym floor, and I knew it was all OK. The line ‚ÄúI am strong again‚Äù is particularly poignant in that way.</p>    <br>    <p><i>A soul that once was hungry for beauty <br>  Now rejoices with you in the morning.<br>  It's love so strong that makes me wonder<br>  Would my heart still beat on its own?</i><br>  <br>  Analysis: if you need much explanation on this, you never felt drum corps like I did. I wondered, literally, if I could make it without my corps mates when the season ended. It turns out I could, but that‚Äôs how much these relationships meant to us. And it resonates with the members today in just the same way... the year is irrelevant.</p>    <br>    <p><i>As I hold you near in silence<br>  How fragile is the time that we share<br>   Together</i><br>  <br>  Analysis: these lines, unfortunately, remind the corps of some difficult things. First, their time together is always coming closer to an end. Second, no matter how hard we may try, we will never get the same members and staff in the same place ever again, period. Because third, we have lost members during their marching years, shortly after aging out, or later in life. The time we shared as members of the Colts came to an end. It‚Äôs an incredibly important experience and incredibly important relationships that are incredibly finite.</p>    <br>    <p><i>Hold on...hold on to your dreams.<br> 					Hold on...hold on to what morning brings.</i><br>  <br>  Analysis: these lines encourage us to make the most of our time as a member. To get your toes up a little more. To straighten the leg a little more. To tune that note or do that visual just right each time. To really mean it when the drum major called the corps to attention. We all dreamed of being that person carrying that drum, that horn, that flag, and during our time we must make the most of it, and be completely spent at the end of each block.</p>    <br>    <p><i>In the stillness...<br>  In the first light of dawn I see.<br>  No more shadows,<br>  Where only light carries me on.<br>  I am strong again, but I'll need you when<br>  Morning's gone again...<br>  Hold on...to morning.</i><br>  <br>  Analysis: I think this simply ties a bow on all that is above. We need each other. We miss each other when we are not together. And even when we are older, some mornings, when we wake up, we wonder why our buddy isn‚Äôt there next to us. And we get up anyway, and move on to take care of our day with the same class and effort that we put into our time in the corps.</p>    <br>    <p>I realize after writing this how hollow my words are compared to the power this song truly holds for the members of the corps. However, I cannot help but point out that each point along the way, each reason for meaning behind these words, should be universal for us all. It has nothing to do with a certain style of uniform, the pieces we played, G bugles or Bb horns, free floating snare drums or sling harnesses. It has to do with the relationships and the specialness that is our corps. I hope that this honest attempt to explicate the lyrics will make ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù special to you as well. I hope you someday take the chance to attend the home show in Dubuque and hear the corps play ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù</p>"

Vicki was one of nearly 50 women in the Dubuque area nominated for several awards through the organization, and was one of two to receive recognition for nonprofit work.</p>  <p>""I am very thankful for the recognition from the Women's Leadership Network and for the support from those around me,"" said Vicki. ""It's always wonderful to have the Colts story shared with others. Tonight was a great opportunity to tell the story of the Colts, and the drum corps activity, with the local community.""  <p>Vicki was nominated by a group of board members and volunteers who submitted a letter of support to the Women's Leadership Network. Her nominators write, ""Vicki is a remarkable leader. She is a passionate educator. She is a compassionate mentor. She is an attentive listener. She is a motivator. She is the engineer that has masterfully taken all the moving parts of this well-respected youth organization on the road to represent the people of Dubuque and Iowa. Vicki‚Äôs job description is a difficult task to define, but it is Vicki‚Äôs steadfast leadership that allows it all to happen.""</p>  <p>Vicki was a member of the Colts in 1994 and 1995 as a baritone player. After a few years teaching band in eastern Iowa, Vicki began volunteering with the Colts. This led to a teaching position with Colt Cadets in 2001, and then being asked to be the Colt Cadets director for the 2002 season. The corps in 2001 had 18 members, but by 2012 had over 75 members and was a perennial Open Class finalist.

229,2018,4,11,Updates From The Colts Organization & Board Of Directors,"<p>The Colts Youth Organization is committed to an environment in which relationships are characterized by dignity, honesty, courtesy, respect, and equitable treatment. This includes a commitment to create and maintain a positive organizational culture and climate which:<br>  <uL>  	<li>is welcoming of difference and diversity and is based on inclusivity</li>  <li>encourages members, staff, and volunteers to disclose and discuss incidents of bullying or harassment in a non-threatening environment</li>  <li>promotes respectful relationships across the entire organization</li>  <li>is free from any form or threat of harassment</li>  </uL>  </p>    <p>Over the past 18 months, the Colts Board of Directors and administrative staff have spent significant time reviewing and updating all of our policies, procedures, and operations. We are a nonprofit youth organization, and the safety, well-being, and education of the students we serve is the driving force behind everything we do.</p>    <p>In April of 2017, our Board of Directors completed revisions of the bylaws for the organization (found <a href=""/documents/policy_BOD_bylaws_Apr2017.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). These bylaws provide the organizational foundation on which the business is built. In May of 2017, the Board of Directors adopted a policy that requires annual criminal background checks for all staff and volunteers (found <a href=""/documents/policy_background_checks.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). This policy was enacted in accordance with the Drum Corps International Strategic Plan, adopted in 2017 (found <a href=""https://issuu.com/drumcorpsinternational/docs/dci_2017_strategic_plan_final_print"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>    <p>In March 2018, our Board of Directors completed revisions of the Personnel Policies for Seasonal Staff, which applies to both paid staff members and volunteers. Specific attention was paid to our <a href=""/documents/PersonalConduct_April2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Personal Conduct Policy</a>, which includes behavior between members, between members and staff or volunteers, and between staff and volunteers. Definitions, examples, and reporting mechanisms for abuse, bullying, hazing, hostility, or sexual harassment were added to provide a comprehensive list and examples of behaviors the Colts Youth Organization does not condone or support. Violation of any of these policies by anyone associated with the organization may be grounds for dismissal or termination of employment. The updated document can be found <a href=""/documents/SeasonalStaffPolicies_March2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>    <p>We have also updated policies and all of our reporting processes to be consistent. Our formal ""chain of command,"" from the bottom all the way to the top, is member to section leader, to drum major, to caption head, to program director or tour director, to corps director, to executive director, to board president. Anyone at the Colts is able to go to whomever they are most comfortable, and anyone is welcome to jump straight to the top of our list.</p>    <p>We also firmly believe in, and are committed to, creating and maintaining an open and transparent environment where any concerns can be brought to any person of authority. This culture serves us well, and we are committed to continuing it into the future ‚Äî commonly referred to as providing a ""scholastic environment"" within the organization. To that end, we also understand it is essential we provide an avenue for confidential and anonymous submission of concerns, complaints, and issues. We have added a webpage (found <a href=""/whistleblower.php"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) dedicated to our whistleblower process that allows anyone to submit concerns, complaints, or issues anonymously.</p>    <p>In addition, we have updated our website in several key areas to make these documents easily accessible to anyone. At the bottom of each webpage are links to the Colts Member Handbook, Personnel Policies for Seasonal Staff, our whistleblower process, and our Contact page. Under Quicklinks, our Documents page was divided into one page for Member Documents and one page for Policies and Procedures</p>    <p>The Colts Member Handbook (found <a href=""/documents/MemberHandbook_2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) for 2018 includes language from the updated <a href=""/documents/PersonalConduct_March2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Personal Conduct Policy</a>. The member handbook is updated annually and outlines our expectations of behavior for members. We are committed to creating an environment where member-to-member abuse, bullying, hazing, hostility, or sexual harassment is non-existent.</p>     <p>We are also committed to developing a culture of leadership and member accountability. In September 2015, Howard Weinstein joined the organization, bringing with him a formal leadership program that allowed us to expedite many cultural changes within the corps and helped strengthen our culture of openness, transparency, and accountability. Howard's formal leadership course includes monthly conference calls for leadership training, as well as meetings during camp weekends, and is open to any member of the drum corps. We interview and use an application process to select section leaders and other titled leadership positions within the drum corps. Regular communication between staff and the leadership team continues throughout the summer.</p>    <p>New for 2018, we are offering a scholarship for any leadership team member who completes a bullying, hazing, and inappropriate behaviors course offered online through the <a href=""https://nfhslearn.com"" target=""_blank"">National Federation of State High School Associations</a>. The NFHS is a nonprofit that has ""led the development of education-based interscholastic sports and activities that help students succeed in their lives."" Their programs and trainings reach 18,500 high schools nationally and over 11 million students. The course can be found online <a href=""https://nfhslearn.com/courses/28000/bullying-hazing-and-inappropriate-behaviors"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Through this course, students develop an added awareness of how to respond, handle, and react to situations that may arise on tour or in their personal lives.</p>     <p>All of these updates are designed to make the Colts Youth Organization stronger and allow us to continue providing life-changing experiences for all of our members, staff, volunteers, alumni, donors, fans, and anyone connected to the organization. Drum corps should be an environment free from any form of sexual harassment, bullying, abuse, hazing, or hostility, and the Colts are are committed to creating that environment. Should you have any comments, concerns, or questions, you may direct them to our Board President Peter Hansen (<a href=""mailto:coltsboard63@gmail.com"">coltsboard63@gmail.com</a>), Board Member Cathi Roberts (<a href=""mailto:cathiroberts.omaha@gmail.com"">cathiroberts.omaha@gmail.com</a>), or Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane (<a href=""jeff@colts.org"">jeff@colts.org</a>). We look forward to having another incredible season in 2018, and believe it will be another amazing year for the drum corps activity.</p>"
227,2018,4,1,Alumni Feature: 1993 Colts,"<img src=""/img/news/1993_fullcorps.jpg"" height="""" width=""500"" alt=""1993 Full Corps Picture"" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>1993 was a special year for the Colts, and one that still stands proudly in the memory of anyone assicated with the corps throughout the years. This month, we had several alumni and staff share their memories of that incredible season. Below are some of the many stories these four individuals, and many others who were a part of that season, shared with us.</p>  <p><b><i>From Steve ""Slim"" Delaney, Colts Member 1974 - 1982; Staff 1983 - 1988, 1990 - 2001; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 1995</i></b></p>  <p>About this time 25 years ago, the Colts design team and instructional staff were busy putting together the ‚ÄúFour Seasons‚Äù show. It was without a doubt an upgrade from the ‚ÄúFour Seasons‚Äù show of the prior year, and staff thought it was going to be pretty good. Hopefully, good enough to get the corps into the Friday night show ‚Äì Semifinals ‚Äì later in the season at the Drum Corps International World Championships in Jackson, Mississippi. That was the goal before the competitive season began ‚Äì to advance beyond the Thursday Quarterfinals and into Semifinals. As it turned out, there was a better ending for all of us who were a part of the 1993 Red Team.</p>  <p>Everyone is familiar with the ending to the story - a 12th place finish at the Drum Corps International World Championships. Finals. Performing on Saturday instead of sitting in the cheap seats. The improvement from 20th in 1992 to 12th in 1993 is still one of the largest year-to-year improvements of any corps in the activity.</p>  <p>I didn't play a large role that year, coming in on weekends and saving summer vacation from my day job to tour with the corps whenever possible. My job was to make sure the percussion line moved their feet together. They did, and many viewers, including some judges, remarked that our drum line was one of the best marching drum lines in the country.</p>  <p>One night, about midway through the season, we drove from one place in the Midwest to some other place in the Midwest (they all end up looking the same). Those staffers who finished the drive typically found a local diner for a meal before sunrise, something we called the ‚Äúbreakfast club.‚Äù That morning, I was sitting with Corps Director Greg Orwoll and Program Director Jeff Bridges, and between coffee and pancakes, we spent a lot of time talking about what a special team we had. The staff was incredibly passionate about the season, and the members repeatedly exceeded the goals we set out for them. I mentioned that, as the season had progressed and we kept climbing, my buddies that I marched with back in the day were constantly calling me (on landlines - there were no cell phones back then). ""What's going on?"" was the typical question. ""They're really good"" was the typical response.</p>  <p>Greg and Jeff asked if I'd give a talk to the corps before the show the next night to offer up some perspective on where the corps came from, how special this team was, and the attention it was garnering from a lot of people. I don't recall all of what I said, but I do recall reminding the students that the foundation for the 1993 team was set by the previous years‚Äô corps, we were just witnessing all that work come to fruition now. I also noted that, while there had been many Colts teams before them, and there would be many Colts teams after them, this was their team and their year. And, come the third week in August, it would all be in the history books, and they'd have to ask themselves if they did all they could to make the most of the experience.</p>  <p>Turns out, they did.</p>  <br>  <img src=""/img/news/1993_side1.jpg"" height="""" width=""400"" alt=""1993 Performance"" class=""alignright imageborder""> 				<p><b><i>From Beth Wilson, Staff 1984 - 2010; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 2003</i></b></p>  <p>What I remember most about 1993 was the achievement of something that many people (perhaps even ourselves?) thought was impossible.</p>  <p>The most often heard comment about the 1993 Colts (from others) was ‚Äúthey came out of nowhere.‚Äù Well, everyone knows that that simply isn‚Äôt true, and it is <b>never</b> true about a group that seems suddenly successful. There were years of hard work and struggle to become the corps that ‚Äúcame out of nowhere.‚Äù The plan in 1990, according to Jeff Bridges, was to make Semifinals in 1993 and Finals in 1994. I guess we overachieved and skipped a year.</p>  <p>Saturday morning there was a panic among the staff - not about the show or the kids, but rather about what to wear. None of us - nobody - had brought something suitable for Finals. So, we made a mad dash to the mall. It was Steve Huggins, Ron Coleman, Becky Thurston (Uffie), maybe Leah Ratliff, and myself. I have never bought a black dress and heels so quickly. Just for the record - I still have that black dress, and the receipt from the purchase. Yes, I'm a nerd. That summer still has the best memories with some of the best people I can imagine.</p>  <p>To the kids that stuck around - especially after 1991 - I was so happy for them, that their belief in the corps paid off.</p>  <br>  <img src=""/img/news/1993_side2.jpg"" height="""" width=""400"" alt=""1993 Performance"" class=""alignleft imageborder""> 				<p><b><i>From Christian Baughman, Colts Member 1991 - 1996; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 2017</i></b></p>  <p>What can be said about a ‚ÄúCinderella Story?‚Äù We were the little corps the could. There are so many memories from that summer, it‚Äôs hard to narrow it down to just a few to share. Here are a few of my favorites, though. A small selection of the many stories from that summer, but I think these are things some may not know or remember about that summer.</p>  <p>One of the most unique parts of the preseason was when the drummer from <i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i>, Ed Shaughnessy, came to visit. I think it was at our March camp, and we played ‚ÄúSummertime‚Äù with him. I‚Äôm still not totally sure how he ended up in Dubuque that weekend, but it‚Äôs still one of my favorite camp memories. That camp was also the last time I played mellophone in the Colts brassline - the next camp I was on the podium conducting. I vividly remember my first camp as drum major, and one moment in particular. We were in music ensemble, outside one of the Dubuque middle schools. It was probably drizzling (doesn‚Äôt it always rain on April camp weekend?) and I was watching Miki Sato, a first year front ensemble member from Japan. While conducting, I remember thinking, ‚Äúthis experience is probably as foreign to me as it is to her.‚Äù In fact, I thought it may have been easier to be Miki at that moment. By the end of that summer, I had finally learned how to be competent on the podium, and she had not only learned English, but had taught us all some great Japanese curse words. There is nothing like diving in the deep end to learn to swim.</p>  <p>The summer was a crazy ride, as it always is every season. The corps made great leaps forward competitively, and a little extra push for us came from an unlikely source. Sometimes, it takes an outside voice to tell you how good you really are. One night in July, DCI judge Rich Nicola requested to talk to the corps. After the show, we were all gathered around the cook truck to hear straight from a DCI judge, which was a very rare opportunity. He spoke at length about how special our show was, how special our moment was, and how special the corps was. It was truly a pivotal moment in the summer, after which many of the members started to believe that making a historic run into the top 12 was really a possibility. Rich‚Äôs challenge line was, ‚Äúnow is your time to seize the Golden Chalice.‚Äù We all knew exactly what that meant.</p>  <p>Aside from motivational speeches from a wide variety of sources, competition with other corps was also a major factor that summer. The official line from the corps leadership was always ‚Äújust be your best, be better today than you were yesterday, and leave the schools cleaner than you found them.‚Äù However, in the back of one of the busses, Scott Weber had a list of all the corps who had finished above the Colts in 1992. As the season progressed, more and more corps were crossed out. Scott was always good at saying what everyone else needed to hear, but might have been afraid to say out loud. It was a super exciting (and motivating) part of the summer to watch those corps who had beaten us for so long be crossed off that list.</p>  <p>By the last week of the season, the corps was truly committed to being the best they could possibly be. The staff and the members were constantly pushing each other to be better, and each day you could really see how much the corps improved. You would think the staff would want to continue this and try to squeeze every element of rehearsal out of the corps on the brink of making finals, but Wednesday night Greg Orwoll took the whole corps to see a movie. The choice was ‚ÄúRookie Of The Year‚Äù and it was another Cinderella Story about a 12 year old with a gifted arm who ends up pitching for the Chicago Cubs and taking them deep into playoffs. It was a cheesy movie, but it certainly ended up inspiring real life later that week.</p>  <p>Waking up on Saturday morning and knowing we were going to be able to perform one last time was truly an indescribable feeling. One of the coolest moments of that morning was waking up to a huge banner posted above the cook truck. The hand painted banner read ‚ÄúBluecoats Welcome The Colts To The Top 12‚Äù and had both corps logos on it. We were the first new corps to break into the top 12 in a few years, and it meant a lot to us to have a perennial finalist send that gesture. I‚Äôve always respected and cheered for the Bluecoats since then.</p>  <br>  <img src=""/img/news/1993_staff.jpg"" height="""" width=""400"" alt=""1993 Staff"" class=""alignright imageborder"">  <p><b><i>From Chuck Naffier, Member 1980 - 1984; Staff 1985 - 1987, 1990 - 1999, and 2014 - 2015; Colts Hall Of Fame Class Of 2003</i></b></p>  <p>It all began innocently enough, with enthusiasm and a sense of knowing this time was going to be different. A large returning membership from 1992 created a strong base on which to build the corps. The staff truly was on another level - they were gelling not only as creative and teaching partners, but as life-long friends who truly enjoyed the ride and the activity.</p>  <p>A couple of highlights that still stand out for me‚Ä¶</p>  <p>The winter:<br> We we knew we wanted to create a show based on a concept about changing seasons and were struggling to come up with an opener. After several months of looking, our percussion arranger, Jerry Carpenter, suggested that I ‚Äújust write an original composition.‚Äù This shocked me, because I‚Äôd never written anything in my life, and certainly had no background with composition. However, it set the wheels in motion. Dean Musson, one of the brass instructors, threw out the idea of building off the end of the 1992 show with a musical quote from ‚ÄúCarol Of The Bells.‚Äù The idea took off, and eventually morphed into a series of melodies and impacts that ultimately created ‚ÄúWinter,‚Äù our opener for the show.</p> 				<p>With three of the four seasons down, we were now having trouble finding a suitable piece for summer. We as a staff kept avoiding the obvious - we were hesitant to try to recreate what the previous generation of Colts had done. Under Corps Director Jim Mason, the Colts had played Gershwin's‚Äô ‚ÄúSummertime‚Äù from <i>Porgy And Bess</i> for three years in a row (1980 - 1982). But, no matter what we tried, we kept coming back to ‚ÄúSummertime.‚Äù Finally, we shook off our hesitations and went full steam ahead with ‚ÄúSummertime.‚Äù It really felt like putting the final piece of the puzzle together - the show really clicked now, and we knew we were on to something special.</p>  <img src=""/img/news/1993_weber.jpg"" height="""" width=""400"" alt=""1993 Performance"" class=""alignleft imageborder"">  <p>Now, all we needed were a couple of hot-shot soprano soloists. Enter the Weber brothers. Scott and Eric, Iowa natives and multi-year vets, took on the challenging of wowing crowds across the country every night that year. If you could hear the initial recordings of their auditions from February of that year, you would definitely be wondering what we were thinking. But, those boys went home and dedicated themselves to making it happen. I‚Äôve never been more proud of two performers in my life.</p>  <p>That winter, Ed Shaughnessy, the drummer from <i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i>, visited us at our March camp. He played with the corps on ‚ÄúSummertime,‚Äù and later asked me if he could sign something for me. That autograph with the cover to my brass scores that summer still hangs on my wall to this day, with a personal note from Ed, which I am humbled by daily.</p>  <p>Like anyone who was with us that summer, there are an infinite number of memories from that summer. Just a few that I love to relive, and I‚Äôm sure everyone from that year loves as well:</p>  <p>In both 1991 and 1992, Frank Williams (a member of the Drum Corps International Hall Of Fame) was a brass consultant for the Colts. He was also the brass caption head for the The Cadets of Bergen County, and had made his appearance on the Drum Corps International stage with the incredible Suncoast Sound horn lines in the 1980s. He came in to guide us and answer questions about thing from daily teaching and warmup brass routines, to how to effectively hold a critique when trying to move up. One night in June, at a show in Michigan, Frank was there with The Cadets, who were on immediately before us. After our opening impact, Frank RAN back into the stadium and sat down next Dean Musson and I and proceeded to tell us how incredible the hornline looked and sounded.</p>  <img src=""/img/news/1993_mom.jpg"" height="""" width=""200"" alt=""1993 Music On The March Program"" class=""alignright imageborder"">  <p>At our home show in Dubuque, the Colts celebrated our 30th anniversary and alumni from every era were there. As the corps performed, every impact was greeted with screams and every emotional moment held breathless attention. There were tears from alumni and looks of disbelief as the audience reveled in the best Colts they‚Äôd ever seen. It was no doubt a declarative performance that sent shock waves throughout the activity that night. I‚Äôve still got a recording of the show, and it brings tears to my eyes to this day.</p>  <p>In early August, we were in Kansas and had an exhibition show, as well as a big picnic with the Glassmen and the Railmen. The Glassmen had been our rival all season long, with us constantly leapfrogging each other in placement. That night, the Glassmen and Colts performed for each other, with the corps‚Äô brass staff serving as judges. This relaxed evening showed both groups were truly in this activity for the right reasons, and were all doing this as friends. The evening was a rare chance for us to relax in the heat of a very competitive season.</p>  <p>Finals week was a truly incredible experience for the corps. Heading into Quarterfinals, we had our sights set on The Velvet Knights. We hadn‚Äôt beaten them all season, and they were a crowd favorite. Fortunately, the crowd loved the Colts <i>even more</i>! We finished in 13th that day, but only 0.4 out of Finals. Returning to the housing site, we immediately got to work, knowing the next 48 hours would be a blur. There was no celebration, just a more determined corps. Celebrations are for when you‚Äôre done, and we weren‚Äôt done yet.</p>  <p>On Friday, we kept our routines the same, knowing that routine was our friend and it had gotten us this far. One thing changed during Finals week - one thing which I think still made other corps scratch their heads. We warmed up in an area far away from the other corps. No one saw us do our thing. No one saw us prepare. We were an unknown. The busses pulled up to the stadium, the members filed off the busses in full uniform, and immediately headed to the starting line. The corps was as close to perfect as they were going to be, and they truly lit the place up.</p>  <p>We all waited in the end zone - many members were too nervous to make eye contact. Staff shuffled their feed in the dirt. Brandt Crocker was announcing the scores (as he always does) and we held our breath as he started listing scores off. The Colts had already been announced at an 84.2 (our highest score to date). As Brandt slowly listed off the scores, we heard ‚ÄúThe Velvet Knights‚Ä¶ with a score of‚Ä¶ 83 point‚Ä¶‚Äù and the rest was lost in the screams of joy from the corps. It wasn‚Äôt until later that night we realized we had tied with the Glassmen for 11th place. We knew that we had achieved a once-in-a-lifetime goal ‚Äì put a drum corps from Dubuque, Iowa into DCI Finals. And, we did it as friends. We did it without tearing others down. We did it with joy. We did it through fierce determination and setting goals that were lofty.</p>  <p>There‚Äôs a picture of us all next to one of the vans the day of Finals. It‚Äôs still one of my favorite pictures. I‚Äôll always remember my friends from that year, the members, every minute on the road, and how much we learned, celebrated, built trust among ourselves, and set the standard for every future version of the Colts. I will cherish that year, and that group of people, forever.</p>  <br>  <p>After the 1993 summer, Chuck Naffier put together a video commemerating the season.

224,2018,3,1,Alumni Feature: 1976 Winter Guard,"<img src=""/img/news/1976_guard_1.jpg"" height="""" width=""400"" alt=""1976 Winter Guard"" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>History was being made in drum corps 42 years ago this winter. And our corps, in particular our winter guard, was the reason for it. There were 21 girls from Dubuque, with the exception of one, that had some raw talent. In essence, they were a diamond in the rough.</p>  <p>In the late 1960‚Äôs, the corps color guard had made a name for itself. In the winters of 1970 and 1971, Colts Director and Hall of Famer Jim Killoran made efforts to start a winter guard. It was not until the fall of 1975, when Colts Hall of Famers Merle Mathis and Al Beckius sought to provide the opportunity for the color guard to be active in the winter months. With the able assistance of Tom Faulkner, they set out to find some able body person(s) to take on the role of developing a winter guard for the corps.</p>  <p>The first candidate declined. His view was that these ‚Äúfarm girls‚Äù from Iowa did not have the skillset or ambition to make the effort worthwhile. However, that candidate did provide names of instructors who might be interested. The corps was directed to reach out to Steve Suslick and Wally Meissner. Both had marched and worked with the Cavaliers Color Guard.</p>  <p>When Steve and Wally arrived at the first rehearsal, they were met by 21 na√Øve, happy go lucky young ladies. On rifle, there was Jody Bowman, Judy Delaney Cooper, Carol ‚ÄúJelly‚Äù Jellison Sessions, Mary Sue ‚ÄúEddie‚Äù Lange Crabtree, Patti ‚ÄúTink‚Äù Mathis McClain, Dawn ‚ÄúDurf‚Äô Murphy Carney, Joan McCann Vasquez. On flag, there was Ann Fangman Vrotsos, Chris ‚ÄúC.B.‚Äù Faulkner, Ellen ‚ÄúAlvin‚Äù Golinvaux, the late Lisa ‚ÄúLevi‚Äù Ingram, Vicki ‚ÄúKrooz‚Äù Kruser, Mary ‚ÄúBubbles‚Äù Mathis, Robin ‚ÄúSpace Cadet‚Äù Phillips, Janis ‚ÄúCover Girl‚Äù Sanner, Lora ‚ÄúCrusher Schueller; and Cynthia ‚ÄúShitmeg‚Äù Steichen. The American Flag Section of Teresa ‚ÄúTess‚Äù Milligan, Deanne Mitchell Gibboney, and Donna ‚ÄúTeta‚Äù Engler Pluym. Their commanding officer was Jolene ‚ÄúTrigger‚Äù Miller O‚ÄôToole. These young ladies, a majority who were only 15 and 16 years old, were met by two color guard visionaries with the technical skills and experience to match. The consensus after the first rehearsal was that Suslick was a ‚Äújerk.‚Äù It was not apparent to these young ladies, the first competitive winter guard in Colts history, that Suslick and Meissner saw something in them that they themselves did not envision.</p>  <p>Steve and Wally demanded the best. They expected no less. When Steve and Wally were away, the onus of perfecting the show fell on the shoulders of corps color guard alumnus, Jane MacFarlane Kohl, Betty Wahlburn Cromartie, and Ellen Fangman McNichols. During the week, these three stalwarts continued the vision that Steve and Wally implemented.</p>  <p>In January of 1976, the girls had several hurdles to overcome heading into the competitive season. They were young. They were inexperienced. They were the only guard that had to travel long distances to compete. Most shows were in the Milwaukee and Chicagoland area. In essence, the guard ventured into the lion‚Äôs den every weekend to compete against the powerhouses of the day: Kilts, Silhouettes, Guardsmen, Buccaneers, and Babcock Debs, to name a few. When most of the guards slept at their homes on Saturday night between competitions, the girls slept in hotels or a gym floor. Car-pooling was the norm, in which some of the guard members were designated driving duties. Trips to these areas back in the 1970‚Äôs were not like it is today. For the first time, winter guard shows were set to music. On top of that, the Colts Winter Guard was the new kid on the block. What was really expected of them their first season out?</p>  <p>At the first show of the season, the Colts surprised quite a few folks. They came in third in Greenfield, Wisconsin. Mary ‚ÄúBubbles‚Äù Mathis took first in in individual flag competition and Joan McCann Vasquez took sixth in individual rifle. The next day, the guard inched up to second place in Chicago, just 0.4 of a point behind the Kilts. Jolene ‚ÄúTrigger‚Äù Miller O‚ÄôToole was awarded Top Commanding Officer.</p>  <p>The girls began to sense some animosity by the other guards. How can these upstart ‚Äúfarm girls‚Äù from Iowa get this credit for their first season out? A story has it that at one competition, Jody Bowman could not find one of her boots. There was a discussion amongst the guard that whomever was pulling the prank needed to return Jody‚Äôs boot. No boot was returned, and Jody went on to compete with a sock instead. After the competition, the boot reappeared with a message on the bottom of the boot saying something to the effect of, ‚ÄúCow shits go home!‚Äù The guard sported a western theme uniform and two Kilts guard members, in an attempt to get under Jolene‚Äôs skin, began calling her ‚ÄúTrigger.‚Äù However, the nickname stuck and became a badge of honor for Jolene. Ironically, those two Kilts members eventually instructed the Colts color guard in the late 1970‚Äôs into the 1980‚Äôs, Kirt Kinyon and Dave Nelson.</p>  <img src=""/img/news/1976_guard_2.jpg"" height="""" width=""500"" alt=""1976 Winter Guard"" class=""alignright imageborder"">   <p>Instead of folding, these girls from Iowa fed off the jealousy, pushing themselves to prove that they were as good as the scores and placements dictated. Steve, Wally, and the rest of the staff gave them the product and know-how to be a top winter guard. A few weeks later, the guard won prelims in Racine, Wisconsin, topping a field of 20 other guards. Yet, at finals, they were beaten by the Silhouettes, whom had jumped up five spots and over eight points to win at finals. The guard was full of mixed emotions. Was politics in play? Did the other guard have a bad prelim show and just took it to everyone at finals? Feeling bummed, the guard headed to the next competition in Carpentersville, Illinois, via carpool. But things did not go smoothly. While the rest of the guard made it to the hotel, the Commanding Officer and Crusher were nowhere to be found. Their car went on a detour to Indiana. The two eventually made it to the hotel in the wee hours of the morning.</p>  <p>So how did these young girls react? Well, they won their next three competitions against the established powerhouses. Though the animosity remained, it began to wane as the other guards began to realize the Colts were a force to be reckoned with. In fact, the winter guard fans gave the girls from Dubuque ‚Äúrock star‚Äù receptions at shows, to the degree that announcers at the shows were virtually drowned out by the reaction of the crowd when the Colts were announced. But would complacency set in? Come mid-March, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the guard came in sixth place. Suslick rewarded the girls with an extended rehearsal that evening in the gym. You could hear a pin drop. The next day in Waukesha, the guard came in first. We have all heard the mantra ‚Äúto be the best, you have to beat the best.‚Äù The rest of March saw the guard coming in short, placing second in the next three competitions.</p>  <p>The Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championships (the precursor of WGI) was on the horizon. The Colts were definitely the dark horse in the competition. Would they accomplish what the staff suspected they could attain? Would they achieve what they never thought was possible at the beginning of the season? Would they get the respect and placement they worked for and deserved?</p>  <p>Sitting first after prelims, a concern was in the back of their minds that what happened in Racine earlier in the year could happen again: that they could be usurped and not take home the gold. Adding to the tension was a dilemma. You see, throughout the season there were seven rifles, but only six positions in the drill. At each competition, one of the six would sit out a show. And one person, Judy Delaney Cooper, had to learn the drill and the counts for the rifle work for each of the six positions and would fill in for each of the other rifles when it was their turn to sit out a competition. But who was going to sit out for the Championship?</p>  <p>That decision was placed on the rifle line. They had to choose amongst themselves who would sit out of the most important show of the season. The gold medal was on the line. Mary Sue ‚ÄúEddie‚Äù Lange Crabtree unselfishly took the hit. To make up for it, Deanne Mitchell Gibboney offered up her position in the American Flag Section at retreat to allow Mary Sue to be on the floor when the final scores were announced.</p>  <p>Ten of the 29 guards from prelims advanced to finals. There were six placement changes from prelims to finals. ‚ÄúIn fourth Place with, 0.1 in penalties, and a final score of 86.567.... Kilts. In third place, with 0.3 in penalties, with a final score of 87.933‚Ä¶ Silhouettes.‚Äù The tension was building. Would the wildest dreams of Suslick and Meissner bring these ‚Äúfarm girls‚Äù from Iowa to the top of the color guard world? Would these girls from Iowa reach a goal that they never thought fathomable just a few months earlier? ‚ÄúIn second place, with 0.3 in penalties, with a score of 88.800...‚Äù Oh, would that penalty cause us a Championship? Would we be judged for what we did and not where we are from? ‚Äú... The Guardsmen.‚Äù On April 10, 1976, the Colts Winter Color Guard was announced the 1976 Midwest Color Guard Circuit Champions with a score of 89.534. (and no penalties).</p>  <p>This was just a tip of the iceberg of what the guard achieved in 1976. We would like to thank the 1976 guard members and Al Beckius, who we were able to contact for this write-up. There were numerous antidotes that we just could not get into this story. We could write a book about this remarkable group of young women. Speaking with them today, one could feel the esprit de corps that exudes. What they accomplished as young women can be sensed in what they have accomplished in the rest of their lives. They are a very special group of folks. If you want to know more, make sure you make it to the alumni festivities to celebrate the corps 55th Anniversary on July 13, 2018, in Dubuque, and get your chance to speak with members of the 1976 Winter Guard.</p>"

220,2018,2,1,Recap On 2018 Auditions,"<img src=""/img/news/2018_jan_ensemble.jpg"" height="""" width=""300"" alt=""January Camp Ensemble"" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>Last month, the Colts wrapped up their formal audition process for the 2018 season. The Colts saw incredible turn out this year as students auditioned for one of the limited 154 positions in the corps. This year, the Colts hosted eight events in November, December, and January, as well as video auditions for color guard. New this season were one-day audition camps in St. Louis, Missouri for brass; Tampa, Florida for color guard; Miami, Florida for brass; and San Antonio, Texas for percussion. By increasing the number of audition locations, the Colts were able to audition more students, make drum corps more accessible for more students, and bring the unique Colts experience to a wider range students.</p> 				<p>November camp, over the Thanksgiving weekend, had a near-record turn out of students auditioning in brass, percussion, and color guard. <!-- Following the camp, over 70 contracts were offered, thanks to a combination of strong veteran retention and a high level of talent from new students.--> Auditions continued quickly after, with every weekend in December except Christmas having a Colts audition event. Throughout the four one-day audition camps, attendance remained strong and brought in a great pool of students for auditions. As is the Colts tradition, the December camp for brass and percussion in Dubuque fell on one of the coldest and snowiest weekends of the winter. Highs on Sunday were only negative seven, without the wind chill!</p>  <p>In January, the Colts again hosted an audition and reherasal in San Antonio, Texas. By doing a second event in Texas, it allowed the percussion to have a full rehearsal as they would in Dubuque, but without every student having to pay for a flight. The next weekend was a three day camp in Dubuque at the Five Flags Center, the Colts favorite winter home. Following the January camp, nearly all positions in the brass and percussion section have been filled, with color guard spots still open for April.</p>  <p>This month, the Colts will host a brass only camp in the Dubuque area the weekend of February 16 - 18. March will not have a camp, due to the growing intensity of guard, percussion, and wind indoor groups through Winter Guard International. All three sections will be back together again in Dubuque the weekend of April 27 - 29 for a final rehearsal weekend before summer starts. April will also allow the Colts to contract the remaining color guard. The percussion and color guard will move in on May 20, the brass will join on May 25, and the season will be underway!</p>"

In total, the Colt Cadets volunteers prepare an average of 400 meals per day during their 45-day tour. During the winter, the trailer is used by the Colts to transport food and cooking supplies to winter audition camps.</p> 				<p>In the past few years, the Colts received grants from the DRA that assisted with the purchase of a custom tent for our souvenir marketplace, percussion equipment for the Colts Cadets, and new uniforms for both corps in their 50th anniversary season in 2013.</p>		 				<p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $375,000 for new instruments, uniforms, vehicles and trailers, computers, and building improvements.</p> 				<p>Thank you to the DRA for continuing to support the vision of the Colts Youth Organization and our mission to ""use music & excellence to teach other about success in life.""</p> 				<p>More information can be obtained by calling the Colts Office at <a href=""tel:5635824872"">563.582.4872</a>, by emailing <a href=""mailto:jeff@colts.org"">jeff@colts.org</a>, or by visiting <a href=""/"">www.colts.org</a>.</p>"

The Colt Cadets finished 14th at the DCI Open Class Championships in Michigan City on Monday, and ended their season with a score of 60.925 Thursday morning in Lucas Oil Stadium. The Colts made a strong charge at the end of the season, being featured on their fifth consecutive ""Big, Loud, and Live"" brodcast on Thursday, August 10, and ended the season in 15th with a score of 83.888. Many throughout finals week commented on how the corps performance, and the corps program <i>""Both Sides Now,""</i> was the strongest they have seen from the Colts in many years.</p>  <p><i>Photo courtesy of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/JonBraudePhotography/"" target=""_blank"">Jon Braude Photgraphy</a>.</i>  <p>Both corps wrapped up their competitive seasons and dismissed from Ball State University on Saturday, August 12. The end of season wrap up for both corps included speeches from all caption heads, both corps directors, playing of the corps song, and, for Colts, speeches from its 25 age outs.</p>  <p>The Colts media team was hard at work throughout the summer, documenting every move, rim shot, and catch on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dcicolts/"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/dcicolts/"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>. Be sure to check out the great pictures and videos!</p>  <p>This summer brought many new and exciting things to the Colts, including new design and instructional staff, the corps first visit to the northeast since 2012, the corps first visit to Florida since 2008, and brand new uniforms. In total, the corps traveled over 12,000 miles this summer and did so with incredible smoothness and flexibility, thanks in large parts to strong partnerships with <a href=""https://www.gowindstar.com"" target=""_blank"">Windstar Lines</a> and <a href=""https://www.hirschbach.com"" target=""_blank"">Hirschbach</a> semi tractors. The new design and instructional staff brought many unique perspectives with them, which all meshed together incredibly well to create one of the most aesthetically pleasing and enthralling shows of the summer. The corps stops in the northeast included three parades around the Boston area - in total, the Colts performed for an estimated 100,000 people in one day. Moving quickly down the highway to the Sunshine State in just three nights, the Colts spent three days in Florida, performing twice, before heading back north to Dubuque for the annual home show, <b>Music On The March</b>.

First-year director David Alford did an incredible job of recruitment and brought together one of the largest groups Cadets has seen in their entire history. In total, there were 87 students this season. This increase in numbers allowed the design team, led by first-year program coordinator Phil Snyder, to challenge the members of the Cadets in new ways with show pacing, content, and overall design. The Cadets celebrated their 50th anniversary with a large crowd of alumni on Saturday, July 15, at Eagle Point Park in Dubuque. The event featured a cook out and a performance from the Colt Cadets. You can read more about the event <a href=""/2017_192"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. 2017 also saw the induction of Sonia Hickson, founder and first director of the Colt Cadets, into the <a href=""/people-hof"" target=""_blank"">Colts Hall of Fame</a>.</p>  <p><i>Photo courtesy of Brent Smith.</i></p>  <p>The organization as a whole also had many successes throughout the summer. June and July featured three great events planned by the Alumni Steering Committee that brought together the alumni from both corps together to celebrate the season and reconnect with the current membership. August saw the recognition of Bill Symoniak as one of the DCI Volunteers of the Year. Construction at the warehouse has continued, and most of the office spaces are almost ready to be moved into!

Full details are still being sorted out and will be announced following the May camp.

You can also help fellow members by offering a ride in your vehicle. You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href=""/rsvp.php"" target=""_blank"">RSVP</a>.</p>  <br>  <p><b>AUGUST AIRLINE PLANS</b><br> <p>For those who will be flying home after finals, please note: You should purchase a plane ticket home no earlier than 6:00 AM on Sunday, August 13, from the Indianapolis Airport (IND). We will run a bus from the stadium to the Indianapolis Airport after finals early Sunday morning. A fun-filled overnight at the airport awaits you with about 2,000 other corps members!</p>  <br>  <p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br> These parts have been added to your bill and will be emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out after Car Wash. Each brass and battery member receives a plume, member shirt, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals/DM also receive gloves). Prices for Brass/Percussion/DM will be $50. Guard members pay $75 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, under uniform garments and other necessary personal items.</p>  <br>  <p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 10, 2017</b><br> This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have close to 30. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible! You can access the pledge sheet and instructions on the <a href=""/documents"" target=""_blank"">Member Documents</a> page.</p> </p> <p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership agreement. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 10 from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.</p> <p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $45,000 in our one-day event!</p> <p>Please plan, so that you can do your share. It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones.</p> <p>The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p> <p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge of a penny per car total will end up being around $8. If we wash 750 cars across approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received for you. We then collect these payments through the office by mail. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory. <p>We ask that parents will help by signing up to supervise a car wash location and help provide transportation of students to their car wash locations to begin at 9:00 AM.</p>  <br>  <p><b>SUMMER TOUR HELP!</b><br> We are scheduling summer volunteers. Check your schedules and let us know. Remember, we can be very creative in getting you in and out of tour.

Your car will be kept throughout the summer at our vehicle lot at the corps hall. The lot is not secured. We prefer that you do not leave a car in Dubuque for the summer. If you have no other alternative, please contact <a href=""mailto:jason@colts.org"">Jason</a> in advance of the weekend. Please only leave your car in Dubuque if absolutely essential. <i>Although we do our best to keep everything safe, the Colts accept no responsibility for cars left in Dubuque</i>.</p>  <br> 	<p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br> 		These parts have been added to your bill and will be emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out at the Memorial Day camp. Each brass and battery member receives a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals/DM also purchase gloves). Prices for Brass/Cymbals/DM will be $100; Battery $80 (no gloves); Front Ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $150 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag, and other necessary personal items.</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 10, 2017</b><br> 		This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p> 	<p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 10.</p> 	<p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $45,000 in our one-day event! It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas, and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones. The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel.</p> 	<p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge will end up being around $7.50. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received. We collect these payments through the office by mail or online. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5.00. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p> 	<br>  <p><b>DCI WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS HOTEL & TICKETS</b><br>  Finals Week is August 10 - 12 in Indinapolis, Indiana. There are still great seats and great rooms available for the best week of the summer! Please note that the Colts WILL perform August 10 and 11, but are not guaranteed a spot in finals on August 12.

180,2017,4,26,Colts Alumni Network Summer Events,"<img src=""/img/alumni_fb_photo.jpg"" width=""350"" height="""" alt=""Hall Of Fame logo"" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>In preparation for the Colts 55th anniversary in 2018, the Colts Alumni Steering Committee has been meeting monthly to establish an alumni network for the corps. The committee is composed of members from every generation of the corps, stretching through the years as Junior Dukes, Legion-Aires, Colt .45, and finally as the Colts. The main goals are to establish a strong alumni network that allows alumni to engage with each other and for alumni to engage with the current corps membership. A new tradition began this winter, with various alumni speaking to the members at their camps. The alumni include Dave Lang (baritone, 1977 - 1985), Scott Weber (soprano, 1989 - 1993), and Britt (Panuska) Cromwell (baritone, 2004 - 2007). For the April camp, Steve Delaney (more commonly known as ""Slim""), cymbal and timpani player from 1973 - 1982, will be speaking to the corps.</p>  <p>For the summer, there are several events planned for the alumni to reconnect, and to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Colt Cadets. On Friday, June 23, the Colts will be hosting its seventh annual <a href=""/summerpremiere"" target=""_blank"">Summer Premiere</a> at Loras College. This free performance will be the first time the Colts and Colt Cadets will present their full competitive shows for the 2017 season. Immediately following, there will be an alumni get-together at the new Colts building, located at <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/2300+Twin+Valley+Dr,+Dubuque,+IA+52003/@42.4611251,-90.6784869,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87e32952a306d667:0xb8304dc54e7c3f17!8m2!3d42.4611212!4d-90.6762929"" target=""_blank"">2300 Twin Valley Drive</a>. This event will be bring-your-own refreshments, ""potluck"" style, and will include a tour of the new facility.</p>  <p>On Friday, July 14, the Colts will host its annual home show, <a href=""/dalzell_dbq"" target=""_blank"">Music On The March</a>, at Dalzell Field on the campus of Dubuque Senior High School. The show begins at 7:00 PM, but starting at 5:00 PM there will be an alumni tailgate just down the street from the high school at St. Anthony's Catholic Church. This event is being sponsored by several generous alumni, but donations will be accepted throughout the evening to benefit the corps. After the home show, alumni can return to Champps's Americana restaurant for a late-night hang out. A block of rooms is also set as at the <a href=""https://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/iowa/hampton-inn-dubuque-DBQIAHX/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Hampton Inn Dubuque</a> for the nights of July 14 and 15.</p>  <p>The next morning, on Saturday, July 15, the Colt Cadets will present a stand-still performance of their 2017 competitive show at Eagle Point Park in Dubuque. The concert will begin at 11:00 AM, with a picnic to follow. Alumni are encouraged to attend and celebrate the Colt Cadets current season, as well as their 50th anniversary. The Colts will be able to provide plates, napkins, cutlery, and a grill, but alumni are asked to bring their own dish to share. The picnic will conclude by 3:00 PM.</p>  <p>More information and specifics will be posted closer to the events on the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ColtsAlumni"" target=""_blank"">Colts Alumni Facebook Page</a>. Be sure to ""like"" the page, and encourage alumni who marched with you to do the same. Thank you for all your support of this great organization as the Colts head into their 54th season!</p>"

You can let us know if you have extra room or if need a ride on your <a href=""/rsvp.php"" target=""_blank"">RSVP</a>.</p> 	<p>For those who will be flying home after finals, please note: You should purchase a plane ticket home no earlier than 6:00 am on Sunday, August 13, from the Indianapolis Airport (IND). We will run a bus from the stadium to the Indianapolis Airport after finals early Sunday morning. A fun-filled overnight at the airport awaits you with about 2,000 other corps members!</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>PERSONAL UNIFORM PARTS</b><br> 		These parts have been added to your bill and will be emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out at the Memorial Day camp. Each brass and battery member receive a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals/DM also purchase gloves). Prices for Brass/Cymbals/DM will be $100; Battery $80 (no gloves); Front Ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $150 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag and other necessary personal items.</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 10, 2017</b><br> 		This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p> 	<p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 10.</p> 	<p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $45,000 in our one-day event!</p> 	<p>Please plan, so that you can do your share. It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas and whatever else. Our one and only fundraiser for members does the same thing as many small ones.</p> 	<p>The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel. It's extra important that we do well this year with what is happening in the world and with beef prices going crazy.</p> 	<p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge of a penny per car total will end up being around $8. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received for you. We then collect these payments through the office by mail. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory.</p> 	<br> 	<p><b>REMAINING REHEARSALS</b><br> 		May 21, 2017: Pre-season Move In for Guard and Percussion, Dubuque Armory<br> 		May 26, 2017: Move In For Summer, Roosevelt Middle School, Dubuque<br> 		May 29, 2017: Parade and Summer debut concert in Dubuque, Iowa</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>EMAIL AND WEBSITE</b><br> 		Please make sure you have received audition information in your area of interest!

This allows students to experience a variety of sections or instruments to find what suits them best. </p>  <p>During the summer the Colt Cadets will perform for more than 75,000 people in seven states. In 2016, Colt Cadets will again finish the season at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis (home of the NFL Colts), at the Drum Corps International World Championships.

Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second and final audition, or 3) a suggestion that you come back again next year. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so plan accordingly so we can be sure of our commitment to each other.<br> 		<br> 		If this is your second or third rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, and please be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, please make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.<br> 		<br> 		Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal.

It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br> 		<br> 		If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. We can usually work it out with you. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p> 		<br> 	<p><b>PARENTS</b><br> 		An informational meeting for parents will be held Friday evening at 8:45 pm in a location to be announced. Detailed schedules with the location will be at the check-in table. Bring all of your questions!<br> 		<br> 		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for.

Katherine Eichhorn was a Colts member and mellophone player who began marching in the Colt Cadets in 1994 and moved up to the Colts in 1997 before aging out in 2002. This initial version of the Colts website (pictured left) looks simple now, but when it was designed was considered ahead of its time for the drum corps activity. Katherine's father and board member, Randy Eichhorn, purchased the domain name colts.org for the project and allowed the corps to use it.</p></div></div><div class=""row mb-2""><div class=""col-md-3""> <img src=""/img/news/website_2.png"" height=""125"" width=""225"" alt=""Website Design 2"" class=""w-100 img-fluid imageborder"" /></div><div class=""col-md-9""><p> As the Internet age continued to expand and become more prevalent around the world, the corps website was updated again (pictured right). However, the capabilities of the Internet were still developing - all forms had to be printed off and mailed or faxed in. While it's not that exciting today, having a fax machine in the early 2000's was still a big deal. This version debuted in 2002, again designed by Katherine as she completed her MIS degree at Iowa State University. Katherine is currently a product and solutions specialist at tickets.com in New York City.</p></div></div><div class=""row mb-2""><div class=""col-md-3""> <img src=""/img/news/website_3.png"" height=""125"" width=""225"" alt=""Website Design 3"" class=""w-100 img-fluid imageborder"" /></div><div class=""col-md-9""><p> Throughout this time, Katherine was the only one who was able to update the website - all changes had to be sent to her before they could be uploaded. Around 2002, the ability to post news articles on the website was added, allowing the office staff to post directly to the website. With this change came another redesign of the website, which has been the website used since (pictured left). The design was a collaborative effort between several designers and creators, including Katherine and Jeff MacFarlane. This website redesign provided a major face-lift for the corps, allowing far more options for design and the amount of information that could be posted.</p></div></div><p> During the Colts 50th anniversary season in 2013, discussions began again about redesigning the Colts website and alumnus Brandon Rogers was engaged to design the framework for the new website. Brandon Rogers was a trumpet and mellophone player starting in 2004 and aging out in 2007. Brandon currently works as a web developer with CloudCraze, a Chicago based company that develops web-based storefronts designed to engage and collaborate with Salesforce. The creation of the website framework was completed in 2015, allowing the office staff to take over and begin transferring all data and files from the old website to the new.</p><p> A huge thank you to all who have been a part of the Colts' various websites throughout our time as an organization, but especially to Katherine and Brandon. Without their dedication, creativity and passion, the organization's presence online would not be what it is today.</p>"

During his time on the board, Peter helped organize the Colts' appearance in the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Parade and has been responsible for running the Brass Impact show in the Kansas City area since 2010. Appointed to Vice President was Jim Johnson, who has been active with the Colts in various roles, including member, volunteer, board member, and corps director for the Colt Cadets.

Because the offices are not finished, all work is being done from inside the warehouse in a very modern, open floor plan design (pictured at left). This current set up is just temporary, and the projected timeline to finish all construction is May 1. But, like any good project, it will never fully be done and there will always be things to improve upon. Various stages are already being planned for the building in the future, including leveling the cement pads in the parking lot, a grant for solar panels, a movie screen, and more. Thank you to every parent, member, alum, and volunteer who has helped in the moving and construction so far! The Colts are truly thankful to have such a wonderful support system. This project wouldn't be possible without you!</p>  <p>Construction is still underway, but is going smoothly. Earlier this week, the framing around the boardroom was finished and new cement was poured in the basement to finish the plumbing project for the second bathroom. Other exciting things off the to-do list have been moving the entryway stairs, drywalling of the upstairs bathroom, framing of the upstairs offices, and assembling of the final shelving units. The next projects to finish will be the loft office and atrium area outside the boardroom. To view updated pictures from the construction, you can <a href=""/movingpictures"" target=""blank"">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>  <p>This fall has been an exciting time for the organization and has shifted how the Colts operate in many ways. By having all vehicles on one site, loading and unloading for camps has gone far smoother. Cleaning vehicles and organizing all the miscellaneous parts for vehicles has also become a much simpler job. The move has also allowed the Colts to take a close look at all processes related to the organization. One process that is undergoing change is printing, with steps being taken to reduce the amount of paper used by the organization. Additionally, having a 9,000 square feet warehouse has allowed both staff and volunteers to take a full look at everything the Colts owns and gain a far better understanding of new items to purchase and what items there are more than enough of. For example, so far 27 hammers have been found in the process of moving and organizing the tool shelves.</p>  <p>The sale of the Colts Center, located at 1101 Central Avenue, to the City of Dubuque will be complete very soon. The agreement to purchase the Colts Center was the first step in a multi-million dollar expansion and remodeling of the <a href=""https://www.mfcdbq.org"" target=""blank"">Multicultural Family Center</a>. The expansion will include additional meeting space, presentation areas and office suites, and will allow the center to meet the needs of the city as Dubuque continues to grow.</p>  <p>To celebrate the move and showcase all the new and exciting features of the warehouse, a new campaign titled #WarehouseWednesday is starting on Colts social media. Be sure to follow along on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/dcicolts/"" target=""blank"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/dcicolts"" target=""blank"">Twitter</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dcicolts/"" target=""blank"">Instagram</a>.

Since inception of this program in 1985, over $350,000 has been raised for summer travel expenses of the Colts and Colt Cadets.</p>  <p>Last year the groups washed nearly 800 cars and earned over $40,000 in donations and paid pledges. Proceeds from the car wash will be used for summer tour costs. Increased prices for diesel and food will be a real challenge this summer, and the car wash helps get the two groups down the road.</p>  <p>The car wash is free, with donations accepted.

134,2016,6,3,Colts Organization On The Move,"<p>Not only are the members of the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps on the move as they prepare for the upcoming season, the Colts Youth Organization is making plans to move their offices later this summer. The Colts are working with the City of Dubuque on an agreement to purchase their building at 1101 Central Avenue. If the sale of their current facility becomes finalized, the Colts will move to 2300 Twin Valley Dr., former home of Key City Moving & Storage. While the two have agreed in principle on the City's acquisition, the sale does not become official until the city council takes action at their meeting on Monday, June 6th.</p>  <p>""We are excited for both the future of the Colts and the City of Dubuque as they look to expand the Multicultural Family Center,"" said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. ""The new Colts facility would offer much-needed additional storage, and the ability to finally park our fleet of vehicles on our own property.""</p>  <p>The summer tours of both the Colts and Colts Cadets require many vehicles to move the students and their instruments down the road. Both groups also have meals prepared by volunteers while on the road. For years, the Colts have leased or been given permission to park their vehicles on numerous lots around the city. The organization currently owns four motor coaches, two semi trailers and a tractor, four vans, and numerous small trailers. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, without a large banquet hall at the new facility the organization will no longer operate their three-nights-per-week bingo games that are run by the Colts Booster Club.</p>  <p>""I played Colts bingo as a kid, so there is part of me that is sad we will no longer have a facility to operate our bingo,"" said MacFarlane.</p>  <p>The Colts bingo, as well as other charitable bingos in the area, has been impacted by the popularity of the land-based casinos and, more recently, the smoking ban in 2008.</p>  <p>Colts Bingo will host their final bingo on Sunday, June 5, 2016, at which both jackpot prizes will be awarded. Other than the guaranteed jackpots, the evening will be a regular session of bingo.</p>  <p>Pending approval of their agreement with the City of Dubuque, the Colts plan to remodel the new property on Twin Valley Dr. before moving in following their 2016 summer tour. </p>  <p>""Regarding our bingo, I would like to thank everyone who has ever played or volunteered at Colts bingo through the years,"" said MacFarlane. ""There have been hundreds of bingo players these past decades who believed, and still believe, in the mission of the Colts Youth Organization and what we do for kids.""</p>  <p><i>""We use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life.""</i> This simple mission drives the organization and ensures its continued success. Colts programs provide motivated young people an opportunity to participate in intensive, accelerated performing arts ensembles, and in the process learn life skills that allow them to grow as future leaders.</p>"

(BTW...have you submitted an <a href=""/rsvp.cfm"">RSVP</a> for camp? This is a must before EACH camp and move ins to confirm your attendance.)</p>  <p>For those who will be flying home after finals, please note: You should purchase a plane ticket home no earlier than 6:00 am on Sunday, August 14, from the Indianapolis Airport (IND). We will run a bus from the stadium to the Indianapolis Airport after finals early Sunday morning. A fun-filled overnight at the airport awaits you with about 2,000 other corps members!</p>  <p><b>CHAMPIONSHIPS / TICKETS</b><br> There are a few tickets remaining in the Colts block for the Drum Corp International World Championships held in Indianapolis, IN on August 11-13. To purchase or find out additional information, contact Kevin at <a href=""mailto:office@colts.org"">office@colts.org</a>.</p>  <p><b>Personal Uniform Parts</b><br> These parts have been added to your bill and were emailed with your statement. The parts will be handed out at the Memorial Day camp. Each brass and battery member receive a new plume, member shirt, mirror triangle, and marching shoes (brass/cymbals also purchase gloves). Prices for Brass/Cymbals/DM will be $100; Battery $80 (no gloves), and front ensemble will be $55 (no plumes). Guard members pay $125 for personal uniform parts that will be supplied, including shoes, earrings, flag bag, under uniform garments, warm ups, uniform parts bag and other necessary personal items.</p>  <p><b>CAR WASH, JUNE 11, 2016</b><br> This is a critical project for us, and the only fundraiser for which we expect everyone's participation. We ask that you collect a minimum of 20 pledges or donations, with a total potential value of $175. If you start now and get one per day, you'll have over 40. If you wait until the last day, you'll have a problem. Please make sure your sheets are legible!</p>  <p>The vast majority (90%+) of Colts and Cadets do a great job, but we do remind you that this is a <b>requirement of your membership</b>, agreed to in your membership contract. The car wash will be held Saturday, June 11.</p> <p>As in all facets of membership, we need people who are committed to the success of the Colts. When everyone does their share, we can make more than $40,000 in our one-day event! </p> <p>Please plan, so that you can do your share. It's important to all of us, and it beats having to sell cookie dough, magazines, candy, pizzas and whatever else. Our <b>one and only fundraiser for members</b> does the same thing as many small ones. </p> <p>The money raised from this project helps with tour expenses, especially food and fuel. It's extra important that we do well this year with what is happening in the world and with beef prices going crazy. </p> <p>As a guideline, set a goal of an average value of $10 per pledge or donation. If someone asks the value of a penny per car, the typical pledge of a penny per car total will end up being around $8. If we wash 750 cars at approximately 20 locations, that amounts to $7.50 per pledge. Some pledges will be more, some less. Remember, although you may collect money in advance, you are not required to. You do not need to collect pledges. After the car wash, we will mail letters from the office to the commitments you received for you. We then collect these payments through the office by mail. We prefer to not bill for anything less than $5. Please keep in mind the total goal to raise $175 personally. Twenty donations of a dollar each is not satisfactory. </p>  <p><b>COLTS WISH LIST FOR IN-KIND DONATIONS</b><br> Your time on the road with us on tour. A day or a week!

118,2016,2,12,An Interview With Howard Weinstein,"<p>Dubuque Colts Media recently had an opportunity to sit down with new Colts Program Coordinator Howard Weinstein to get some unique perspectives from the long-time DCI vet. Howard was corps director for the Boston Crusaders from 1999-2007 where he also coordinated the field show. In 2009, he joined the Blue Stars as their corps director and continued through the 2011 season. Enjoy this glimpse into what's ahead for the Colts. </p>  			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>So you had a few years on the outside of DCI looking in. Why was it the right time to get back involved?</i>  </p>  			<p><b>HW:</b> To be honest, I am not getting any younger. <i>(smiling)</i> I have been involved in the drum corps activity since 1983, first as a performer, then as an instructor, and then as a program coordinator and caption head, so I have been blessed to have been involved in the activity in some way, shape or form for a good part of my life. When I left the Blue Stars a few years ago, it was because I had to take some time to set my life up for my future. This was to set it up personally, professionally, and stabilize myself so that I could eventually retire. Now, I am at a place in my life where I felt I was able to get back involved, not at the level I was before, but in a way that I could again have an impact on an organization, and the activity, and this seemed to be the perfect time. 	 </p>  			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>We assume there was more than one corps interested in having Howard Weinstein on their staff. How did you choose to work in Dubuque, Iowa?</i>  			 </p>  			<p><b>HW:</b> Since I have left the activity, I would make it a point to go to the Atlanta DCI Regional and watch each and every corps. Watching the Colts...the organization seemed like a drum corps that would align with my skills, talent and influence. My niche in the activity has been working with performance ensembles and helping them to progress forward both on and off the field, and I really felt that my involvement with the Colts had the potential to be a win-win, giving me a fantastic opportunity to work with the group to continue their legacy in the drum corps activity, and the Colts organization would be able to benefit from my years of leadership, design and accomplishment.  			 </p>  			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>You've been with the group for a few months now. Have you found anything to be unique to the Colts organization?</i>  			 </p>  			<p><b>HW:</b> Well, as you know, the drum corps activity is a lot of the same from organization to organization. That is evident to me, with the Colts being my third legacy organization I have had the honor to work with. I think the biggest difference I have found with the Colts has been the fact that they have the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps within their organization, as well. I find it to be a tremendous positive for several reasons. For example, it's very special when you see members that are coming up into the Colts that have come through the younger group. It also gives us a place to recommend auditionees that are not quite ready for the World Class experience, where they can train, grow and become stronger performers.   			 </p>  			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>The last corps you worked for was in La Crosse, Wisconsin  the smallest market to sponsor a DCI World Class drum corps. Are there any special challenges  or possibly advantages  to working in the second smallest market...Dubuque?</i>  			 </p>  			<p><b>HW:</b> Absolutely, with both corps. The challenge is the limitation of travel in and out of a major metropolitan marketplace. My last organization shifted our winter program to the Indianapolis marketplace for this very reason. We still had everything else in La Crosse, but the move made it easier for members and staff to travel in and out. It also made it financially easier on the organization for wide range of reasons.  			 The advantage of both groups being in a smaller market is the area being aware and supportive of the drum corps being in their community. This is a benefit for sponsorships and fundraisers throughout the year for the corps, as well as individual members.  			 </p>  			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>Is there anything that makes programming the Colts show different from the other two groups you worked with? Or is a drum corps show pretty much the same regardless of the corps uniform, tradition or location?</i>   			 </p>  			<p><b>HW:</b> I am actually finding programming for the Colts extremely limitless. This is based on the history of the corps, and shows they have done in the past. Often, corps will be stuck in a realm of classical, or jazz, etc. I have not found this with the Colts. The uniform, history, and area give our design team an open landscape, where we can go in any direction both musically and visually.  			 </p>  			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>You also program shows for a variety of high school bands, and currently work with the 2014 Bands of America Grand National Champion Tarpon Springs. Aside from no woodwinds, what is the biggest difference between programming for DCI vs. BOA?</i>  			 </p>  			<p><b>HW:</b> I think the biggest difference between designing for DCI verses BOA would be that the make-up of the audiences are different. Think about it, the BOA audiences, that are live in the stands, are about 75% parents of the students on the field, and other bands competing. This is somewhat of a captive audience, and allows the bands to take a great deal of risks, and move in a lot of directions, and for the most part, the audience is going to be pretty supportive. Don't get me wrong, as the General Effect sheets for both activities are written very similar, so we take a lot of the same approaches when it comes to creating effects and synchronizing the music to visual elements of the show.   			 I think the big difference with DCI is maybe with the exception of finals week, the majority of the audience are strictly drum corps fans, and people that have marched in the past. This is especially true at Tour Event Partner shows. At the DCI Regional events, there are a lot of high school bands in attendance, but I think you see the difference of the average makeup of the viewers. For this reason, I feel there is a huge responsibility that the show truly connects with audiences from multiple generations. This has also been encouraged from the adjudication community, as the entertainment value is strongly considered when the group is judged.  			 </p>  			<p><b>DCM:</b> <i>Do you have a long-term vision for the Colts? Or are you just working to get the 2016 program put together, and not get wrapped up in the future?</i>  			 </p>  			<p><b>HW:</b> Currently, with it being my first year with the organization, my main focus has been on the 2016 field show, coordinating and leading the staff  making sure that we are all working in a congruent fashion with aligned goals and aspirations, and implementing a student leadership program.

112,2015,11,19,Colts Name Noah Perkins Drum Major For 2016 Season,"<img src=""/img/news/2015_perkins.jpg"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>A fifth-year member from the brass section, Noah Perkins will gain a new perspective on the drum corps activity from the perch of the Colts podium. Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane and Program Coordinator Howard Weinstein are confident Noah's character and leadership qualities are a perfect fit for the job left vacant by recent age outs Kara Metzger and Cole Hanton.</p>  <p>To gain a better understanding of the 2016 Colts leader, we recently asked Noah to share a little bit about himself, his love of music, and his belief in the Colts.</p>  <p>My name is Noah Perkins. I'm 19 years old studying trombone performance at the University of Iowa, and a four-year member of the Colts baritone section. I also marched four seasons in high school, and one season in college with the Hawkeye Marching Band. I am incredibly honored to be named drum major, and cannot wait to see what the future has in store for the Colts.</p>  <p>As a senior in high school, I saw Wycliffe Gordon and his combo live at a jazz club in Iowa City. The raw energy and passion he performed with changed my outlook on music entirely. I had heard repeatedly in drum corps and elsewhere that music is about ""making the audience feel something,"" and seeing Wycliffe was when I truly realized what that meant.</p>  <p>I was taken to drum corps shows at a very young age although I have no memory of them. My dad marched six years with the Troopers. In 2011, I went to a drum corps show in Davenport, Iowa, and knew then I had to give it a try. My parents have always been supportive. I share the drum corps experience with my sister who has been a member of the Colt Cadets color guard since the time I joined Colts. It's a connection we share that a lot of siblings don't get to. We have definitely grown closer as a result.</p>  <p>My outlook on the activity has changed notably with every passing summer. In the first and even second summers, everything was incredibly exciting and a bit overwhelming. To be honest, I struggled during those years and it's helped me become who I am today. During my third season I learned to relax and enjoy the ride while still working desperately to be excellent. Last summer taught me a lot about what I want in life, and how to push myself even when I think I've hit my limit.</p>  <p>I can't wait to work with the group of educators and designers on Colts staff in 2016, especially those with such excellent track records. The brief time I've spent with Howard has already changed my perspective on drum corps and what it can do for us as individuals. I'm also looking forward to the change from marching member to drum major, and facing a new set of challenges and experiences. I am truly honored to be part of the legacy of Colts drum majors, and I cannot wait to see how excellent the corps can be this season.</p>"
111,2015,9,7,Colts Hand Program Reins To DCI Veteran Howard Weinstein,"<p>The Colts Youth Organization announced today that Howard Weinstein will lead the Colts design team in 2016. Howard has a long history in the drum corps activity as both program coordinator and corps director. His two most recent DCI stops have been with the Boston Crusaders (1999-2007) and the Blue Stars (2009-2011).</p>  <p>Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane is thrilled by the hire. ""Howard and I first got to know each other when we served together on the DCI Board of Directors,"" said Vicki. ""I've always been impressed with the leadership qualities he instills in the groups he works with. We just became a better organization today  and a better drum corps  with Howard on our staff.""</p>  <p>Howard has been a music educator for the past 28 years. He works with many high school programs in Florida and Georgia including Tarpon Springs, the 2014 Bands of America Grand National Champions. He is excited to begin building on the recent momentum of the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps.</p>  <p>""The Colts are wonderfully positioned to make a strong statement in 2016,"" said Howard. ""They have a growing popularity throughout DCI, and a great reputation in the activity for providing a terrific member experience. Vicki and I are assembling a solid team of designers and educators, and we're ready to get down to business.""</p>  <p>Watch for additional announcements on the Colts design and caption heads coming soon. The organization's annual Awards & Recognition Banquet is scheduled for Friday, November 27th at the Five Flags Center in Dubuque, Iowa, followed immediately by the first audition weekend of the 2016 season. </p>  <p><a href=""/info.cfm"">CLICK HERE</a> to request information on becoming a member of the 2016 Colts or Colt Cadets.</p>  <p>For a brief bio of Howard Weinstein, <a href=""/staff_weinstein.asp"">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>"

109,2015,7,28,"A Great Trumpeter, Colts Fan, And Father Leaves The Stage At 83","<img src=""/img/news/2015_bud.jpg"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>On Sunday, July 26, 2015, the Colts were left with a trumpet hole and this time around there would be no replacement. Bud MacFarlane was a wonderful man. He entertained thousands through the years with his musicianship, and I would like to use this opportunity to tell the world a little bit more about him.</p>  <p>Bud had a subtle delivery on the trumpet. From Dixieland to big band to the families' holiday favorites, his syncopated style was smooth as butter on a warm day. His tone was pure unless slightly bent to add a bit of style. He also sang the likes of Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin with a mellow sound that pulled you onto the dance floor. He rarely took center stage although he had all the skills if asked to do so. For more than two decades he was part of The Country Kings, although the group played little country. Instead, they had a big band sound with all the instrumentation and were among the most popular acts at dance halls throughout the Midwest in the '60s and '70s. I was always proud to watch him perform.</p>  <p>My oldest sister, Jane, joined the Colt .45 Drum & Bugle Corps in 1969 at the urging of her friends at Wahlert High School. There she would one day meet her husband of 42 years, Jim Kohl. My Dad would soon be driving the family all over the country to watch the group compete. Shortly after, my older siblings joined her as I waited anxiously to reach the required age of 11 to join the Colt Cadets. By 1973, all four of my older siblings were members of the Colt .45 and I was a Colt Cadet. We were a drum corps family. Somehow my Dad managed to see many shows between his regular job and the band gigs he played most every Saturday night. He remained a drum corps fan through the years although he preferred the older style with songs covered more closely to their original arrangement. He loved the patriotic tunes. Watching the San Antonio regional on Pay Per View, he told me his idea for the greatest drum corps show of all time. I'm not sure it had everything the judges look for these days but I'm pretty sure he was right that audiences everywhere would rise to their feet in appreciation. And for that, Bud, we rise to our feet to salute you.</p>  <p>My Dad was creative, a problem solver, an artist in many sorts of ways, and a diligent worker. He was meticulous is every endeavor whether fine-tuning his golf game or shaving a sliver off his wood working project to get everything just so.</p>  <p>He was a quiet man who preferred to lead by example rather than with words. He treated those around him with respect, and he lived with a level of integrity that will always be the standard I aspire to. He shared love in the simplest ways....often with a subtle wink of an eye that let you know he was with you in mind, body and spirit. He was absolutely best friends with his wife, Ruth (""Cookie""), with whom he celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary in May.</p>  <p>There was a television advertisement some time ago that said, ""Like Mike...if I could be like Mike,"" after the great NBA star Michael Jordan. As I continue my journey through life, I can only hope to wake each day and pursue my goal to be ""Like Bud....if I could be like Bud.""</p>  <p>Thank you for taking a minute of your time to learn about my Dad.</p>  <p>Arrangements for Gerald J. ""Bud"" MacFarlane are being made at the Miller Funeral Home in East Dubuque, Illinois.

108,2015,7,10,"Colts Receive $10,000 Grant From Dubuque Racing Association","<img src=""/img/news/2015_red_zone.jpg"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>When the Dubuque Racing Association announced their grant awards to local nonprofit organizations just before summer, the Colts Youth Organization was pleased to learn it received $10,000 for the rebranding of the Colts Merchandise Marketplace -- a transformation of our souvenir operation from a concessions-style trailer to a pop up tent with display racks.</p>  <p>The new configuration allows customers to have a more interactive buying experience thereby boosting sales. This was the 19th consecutive year that the Colts received a grant of $5,000 or more from the DRA.</p>  <p>The Red Zone made its debut at the Colts Summer Premiere at the University of Dubuque's Chalmers Field on Thursday, June 18th.</p>  <p>While it's hard to project the exact impact on sales, the upgraded marketplace will do a better job of positioning the Colts brand in the crowded corps merchandise areas. The corps also sees the Red Zone as an opportunity to increase recruiting as well among musicians and performers who will be looking to join a drum corps in 2016.</p>  <p>The Dubuque Racing Association (DRA) is the nonprofit license holder for the Mystique and Diamond Jo casinos. Grants have been offered to area nonprofit organizations through a competitive submission process since 1985.</p>  <p>Last year, the Colts received a $12,500 grant from the DRA for the purchase of percussion equipment for the Colts Cadets.</p>  <p>The two years prior, the DRA awarded the Colts the maximum amount offered with $40,000 in 2012 to purchase all-new uniforms for both the Colts and Colt Cadets, and $25,000 in 2013 for the completion of a new roof on the Colts Center at 11th & Central in downtown Dubuque.</p>  <p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $350,000 for new instruments, uniforms, vehicles and trailers, computers and other equipment, and building improvements.</p>  <p>Thank you to the DRA for continuing to support the vision of the Colts Youth Organization and our mission to ""use music & excellence to teach other about success in life.""</p>"

The award was presented today at the USCM Winter Meeting in Washington, D.C.</p>  <p>""I am deeply honored to receive this recognition from the United States Conference of Mayors and Americans for the Arts. In Dubuque, we have strived to ensure that the arts are part of the intrinsic value of our quality of life...the education, inspiration and aspiration!,"" said Buol. ""The Dubuque City Council has consistently chosen support of the cultural arts as a high priority in our goals over the last eight years. Our investment and support has proven to make solid economic sense -- over $47 million dollars of sense for our local economy every year, and a critical element of what makes Dubuque a 'Masterpiece on the Mississippi'.""</p>  <p>Under the leadership of Mayor Buol, the arts and culture have enjoyed a tremendous resurgence as a result of his consistent advocacy of arts and cultural initiatives for the city. In 1995, when he first assumed office, the city provided zero funding for the arts and culture. But, under his leadership of mayor, the city has distributed $2.3 million to arts and cultural groups since 2005 for operating and project support, as well as for a public art project. Upon taking office, Mayor Buol also established an Arts & Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission.</p>  <p><i><b>The Colts Youth Organization has been an annual recipient of an Arts & Cultural Affairs Grant since the program's inception. Last year, the organization received $40,000 for operating support.</b> The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps has been proud to represent the City of Dubuque in their travels throughout the United States for over 50 years.</i></p>  <p>Mayor Buol facilitated the development of Dubuque's Comprehensive Downtown master plan that called for the formation of a cultural district and, in 2005, the city received the first Cultural District designation from the State of Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>  <p>Through Mayor Buol's involvement in the America's River Project, the city has developed a nearly $400 million educational, entertainment, and historic riverfront project at the Port of Dubuque. Specifically, the Mississippi Riverwalk, the American Trust River's Edge Plaza, and the Alliant Energy Amphitheater were built to host multiple community arts and culture activities, including a now thriving roster of festivals. In 2006, Dubuque was named one of the first Iowa Great Places due to projects that sought to expand and continue the revitalization that has occurred along the citys riverfront within the last decade.</p>  <p>""Mayor Buol is an elected official who understands the critical importance of arts, culture and creativity in creating vibrant communities and places,"" said Robert L. Lynch, President and CEO of Americans for the Arts. ""Since 1995, when he began his public service as a city councilman, to 2005 when he was first elected mayor, he has made funding for the arts and culture, along with other arts friendly policy initiatives a priority of his administration.""</p>  <p>""Every year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors recognizes the efforts of those who believe as much as we do, that the arts are the heart of our society. Arts and culture help shape a city's quality of life, but mayors also understand the connection between the arts and business and the arts' impact on the local economy,"" said U.S. Conference of Mayors CEO and Executive Director Tom Cochran.</p>  <p>Three other awards were presented at the breakfast event: Michigan Governor Rick Snyder; Akron, OH Mayor Don Plusquellic, and Actress Fran Drescher were also honored.</p>  <p>Read the official press release on the City of Dubuque's website <a href=""https://www.cityofdubuque.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2223"">HERE.</a></p>"

77,2013,11,25,Colts Prepare For Next 50 Years,"<p>Following a memorable season in which it celebrated its 50th Anniversary, the Colts Youth Organization is preparing for the next 50 years without its most familiar face. Greg Orwoll, the group's development director and former executive director, recently accepted a new challenge as executive director of DuRide in Dubuque. Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane manages the Colts business operation and will take on many of the duties vacated by Orwoll's departure.</p>  <p>""Greg created a wonderful foundation on which we will continue to build the Colts. His philosophies used to develop young students into accomplished leaders and performers will live on here forever,"" said MacFarlane. ""We will certainly miss his three decades of leadership, but I have his number and know he will be there when we need some advice or counsel.""</p>  <p>MacFarlane has been with the Colts Youth Organization since 2005 serving as controller and designer. Prior to joining the Colts, he was more known throughout Dubuque for creating many of the area's iconic logo designs at the company he founded, Get Smart Design (which later became Mission Creative  a property of Woodward Communications). He spent over twenty years in the advertising business before shifting gears and joining the non-profit organization where he participated as a drummer in the 1970s. He grew up with the Colts having watched all four of his older siblings march in the drum corps.</p>  <p>""I used to get a call from Greg every now and then to do a pro bono design project for the Colts,"" MacFarlane continued. ""I look forward to bringing a bit of that marketing focus to the organization as we refine the Colts brand, and spread the word about our mission and the accomplishments of these amazing students we meet year after year.""</p>  <p>The Colts bring one season to a close and begin another this weekend when they host their Annual Recognition Banquet on Friday, November 29th followed immediately by their first audition weekend.

75,2013,8,31,The Year In Review :: 2013,"<p>As August draws to a close, what a great time to reflect on all that's transpired over the past year. We welcomed in our 50th Anniversary, having been founded in 1963, and celebrated throughout the summer as alumni, parents, fans and friends. Thank you to all who performed, donated, volunteered, bought a ticket or a souvenir, taught, or in any other way helped our programs experience the pursuit of our common cause...<i>to use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life.</i> <b>Following are just some of the highlights from this memorable year of the Colts Youth Organization:</b></p>  <p>MARC SYLVESTER HIRED AS COLTS PROGRAM COORDINATOR<br> Soon after Vicki (Schaffer) MacFarlane was named Colts director, she got right to work and named Marc Sylvester to lead the Colts design team as program coordinator for the 2013 season. ""Sully,"" as he has been known throughout the activity for over 30 years, brought his Hall of Fame toolbox to Dubuque to begin painting a fresh canvas for the Colts in their anniversary season. Joining Marc on the design team were returning members Chris Tomsa, brass arranger; Dave Nelson, percussion arranger; Carla Burgess-Tomsa, color guard supervisor; and Brandon Smith, guard designer. Also adding his creativity to the Colts design team in his first year was Aaron Guidry, composer and electronics supervisor.</p>  <p>VIDEO <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2mCtTEYbpY&feature=youtu.be"">Colts 2013: January Camp (An interview with Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane)</a></p>  <p>VIDEO <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh4Ozinl1WA"">Colts 2013: The Stepoff</a></p>  				<p>MATT MULVANNY NAMED COLT CADETS DIRECTOR<br> Matt Mulvanny was named director of the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps in September 2012. A Colts alumnus from 2006, Matt had been on staff with the cadet corps for two seasons, serving as a leader in the marching program and a key member of the brass staff. Matt's excitement for the season was unmistakable, ""I'm looking forward to working alongside an instructional and design staff that continues to inspire the drum corps community every year. Filling the shoes of Vicki (Schaffer) MacFarlane is not a task anybody should take lightly, but with such hard working members, and support from a family of staff that gels so well together, I could not be more enthusiastic about the future of the Colt Cadets.""</p>  <p>VIDEO <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR5vnzhvMQQ"">Colt Cadets 2013: The Debut</a></p>  				<p>SUMMERTIME IN THE DEAD OF WINTER<br> At the February rehearsal weekend, the Colts brass line had the rare opportunity to perform with one of its own from four decades prior. Greg Blum, current president of the Colts Board of Directors, came to prominence within the drum corps activity in the early '80s as soloist on the Colts classic, <i>Summertime</i>. He sat down with Colts videographer Isaac Campbell following the performance to discuss the significance of this piece of Colts history. Isaac produced the interview for his campus television station at the University of Northern Iowa.</p>  <p>VIDEO <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dkV1oQl2tE"">Colts 2013: Summertime With Harpo</a></p>   				<p>COLTS BOOSTER CLUB HOSTS 3-FOR-1 RAFFLE<br>  The Colts Booster Club held a $10-per-ticket fundraising raffle throughout the spring and summer.

Renowned uniform designer Michael Cesario worked with Marc Sylvester to establish the look, and the great team at Fred J. Miller (FJM) brought the uniform to life. The DRA grant required a 25% match from the organization and when development director Greg Orwoll posed the challenge to our supporters, they responded enthusiastically. For $65, a donor could dedicate a uniform in their name or in remembrance of another. Some of the most moving dedications were in honor of Colts family members who are no longer with us. Thank you to all who supported this new look for the Colts and Colt Cadets.</p>  <p>VIDEO <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODbYUDDWSMc"">2013 Colts And Colt Cadets: Revealed</a></p>  				<p>COLTS NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP COLOR GUARD HONORED<br> As part of the 50th Anniversary events, the Colts took a moment to recognize the first national championship in the organization's history. The 2013 Colts members served as the audience while several members and instructional staff of the 1976 Colts Color Guard were introduced and presented with triangles for the years they marched. The guard won the Midwest Circuit Color Guard Championship in Chicago followed by the VFW National Color Guard Championship later in the summer. Following a slideshow tribute, all in attendance were treated to the championship performance which was preserved on 8mm videotape by none other than 1976 corps director Tom Faulkner (who, BTW, was also in attendance).</p>  				<p>COLTS DEBUT NEW LOOK AT MEMORIAL DAY FESTIVITIES IN DUBUQUE<br> The Colts celebrated the men and women of the United States Armed Forces by participating in the annual Memorial Day parade in downtown Dubuque followed by their tribute concert in Washington Park.

The city supports arts and culture by recognizing the contribution such organizations make to the quality of life in the community as well as the significance of their economic impact. The Dubuque Racing Association awarded a grant to the Colts Youth Organization to be used for the replacement of the roof at the Colts Center. Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $340,000 for new instruments, vehicles, uniforms, a souvenir trailer, computers and equipment maintenance. The contributions of these two groups have been critical to our ability to provide top-notch programs for our 300+ students.</p>  				<p>COLTS VISIT THE ORIGINAL FIELD OF DREAMS<br> Celebrating the end of Cornfield Tour, and being the inspiration for their 2013 program, the corps visited the famed movie site just outside of Dyersville, Iowa. The trip presented an opportunity to perform their 2013 ballad on the actual Field Of Dreams. Members of the Colts, Colt Cadets, board members, staff and alumni were on hand for this memorable event.</p>  <p>VIDEO <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnc6Emwn-fs"">Colts 2013: The Place Where Dreams Come True</a></p>  				<p>PANDEMONIUM ENJOYS JAMMIN' FOR THE CROWDS<br> Pandemonium, the Colts-sponsored steel drum ensemble directed by Patti Millius, took on their busiest summer schedule to date beginning with a performance at the Colts Summer Premiere at Loras College on June 22nd, and finishing in early August. Since 2009, Pandemonium has been entertaining audiences while learning a unique blend of melody and rhythm using a wide variety of popular music. The Colts also sponsor the PanrythmiX Steel Drum Ensemble for students in grades 4-5 attending Prescott Elementary School.</p>  				<p>HAV LIFE: WHERE OPPORTUNITY MEETS POTENTIAL<br> Started in memory of Hunter Aaron Vondran, HAVlife is a not for profit foundation that was established to fund the resources students need to pursue their musical aspirations and athletic goals - just like Hunter did. This past summer, HAVlife provided a grant of $5,000 to assist members of the Colt Cadets who may otherwise have not been able to afford their drum corps membership. We are thrilled to have established this partnership and look forward to turning lost potential into long-term achievement in the years to come.</p>  				<p>COLTS SUMMER BAND PROVIDES AN EVENING OF MUSIC IN THE PARK<br> For the seventh consecutive summer, the Colts Summer Band capped their season with a wonderful concert in Eagle Point Park on Tuesday, July 2nd, along with the Colt Cadets. While the size of the summer band remained consistent with 2012, a common review of the concert from those in attendance was, ""This is the best the summer band has EVER sounded!"" Congratulations to directors Brian Enabnit and Dan Norman for providing an incredible experience for this ambitious group of students!</p>   				<p>MUSIC ON THE MARCH MAKES NEW DALZELL FIELD DEBUT<br> Eight drum and bugle corps rolled onto the campus of Dubuque Senior High School on Friday, July 12th, and delivered their world-class performances to a packed house at the newly-remodeled Dalzell Field. The local crowd was enthusiastic and supportive, as they have been for several decades, and Mother Nature cooperated with a spectacular night just up until the time a swarm of mayflies made its way from the Mississippi River to the lights of the stadium. Most in the crowd were not going to let a few summer pests ruin their evening that concluded with recognition of the Colts age outs and encore performances by the Colt Cadets, Colts and the 50th Anniversary Colts Alumni Corps.</p>  				<p>COLTS ALUMNI CORPS PERFORMS AT HOME SHOW AND DCI CHAMPIONSHIPS<br> Brass members from throughout the years joined together to revive a few classics from the Colts repertoire. Thank you to LeAnn Splitter for organizing the group and to all who participated. The alumni corps was complimented in Dubuque by a color guard unit that fashioned uniforms from throughout Colts history, and was lead by former color guard sergeant Jolene (Miller) O'Toole. Many members of the brass group, along with a few others who joined for the Indianapolis event, performed in Lucas Oil Stadium following the DCI World Class Semifinals as they played the 2013 DCI age out class onto the field for their recognition ceremony. The group also performed on Georgia Street earlier in the evening, and finally at the DCI Championships After-Party on Friday night at the Omni Severin Hotel in downtown Indianapolis.</p>  				<p>COLTS FAMILY GATHERS AS ONE FOR 50TH ANNIVERSARY REUNION<br> On Saturday, July 13th, alumni who marched throughout the past five decades, along with many parents and others who offered their support, gathered at the Holiday Inn in downtown Dubuque for an evening filled with stories and memories of days gone by. Emceed by Colts board member Emily Neuendorf, the evening included a few comedic moments from our own Fruit Of The Loom leaf, Gene Steichen, and a great story of perseverance from '90s alum and former staff member Kent Lineberry. The history of the triangle was discussed, and the significance of the medals now given to members who march, and then all of the alums were presented with a triangle commemorating each of their years in the Colts. The evening concluded with Vox One's rendition of the corps song, <i>Morning.</i></p>  				<p>COLTS AND COLT CADETS TAKE A STEP FORWARD<br> The Colts and Colt Cadets each took a step forward within their competitive divisions at the DCI World Championships in Michigan City and Indianapolis. The Colt Cadets reached DCI Open Class Finals for the fourth consecutive year and achieved the highest placement in their history (10th) with their show titled, Red. The Colts 2013 program, Field Of Dreams, was a crowd favorite all season long and the members performed with incredible energy throughout the week. Congratulations to all of the members of both corps who have now joined in the great tradition of Colts and Colt Cadets who've performed throughout the past 50 years. You have laid the foundation on which the next 50 years will be built!</p>  				<p><b>Watch the Colts website in the coming weeks</b> for additional videos from Isaac Campbell from the final weeks of the Colt and Colt Cadets summer tours.

68,2013,5,14,"Brass Member Dakotah Coach, 18, Presumed Drowned","<p>With heavy hearts, we received a call this morning from Shane Coach, father of second-year brass member Dakotah Coach, who informed us that it appeared Dakotah and his friend, Erika Borgstrom, jumped from the Stone Arch Bridge in Minneapolis and are presumed to have drowned in the Mississippi River. The two had been reported missing since last Friday evening.</p>  <p>Witnesses reported seeing two people jump from the bridge around 4:30 a.m. this morning. It is believed they have drowned but police continue their search. Tuesday afternoon, St. Croix Central High School principal Glenn Webb released this statement:</p>  <p>""The St. Croix Central School District community is grieving the loss of two wonderful students. Erika Borgstrom, a sophomore, and Dakotah Coach, a senior, took their own lives early Tuesday morning, May 14, 2013. Both were excellent students and outstanding musicians. They will be missed greatly by all who knew them. Our thoughts, prayers and support go out to their families, friends and the entire community during this very difficult time.""</p>  <p>The Colts send prayers and sincere condolences to the teens' families. Dakotah's father, Shane, has been a regular volunteer at Colts weekend rehearsal camps, along with his grandparents, with whom Dakotah was very close.</p>  <p>Dakotah Coach embraced many of the qualities that make everyone in the Colts family so proud of its members. We remember the Dakotah we met last spring who came to his first drum corps audition young and inexperienced. Earning a position was not easy for Dakotah, and he had to push himself to a level that he may not have known existed. He persevered. He continued working toward his goal, and on Memorial Day, a year ago, he slipped into his uniform jacket for the first time as a member of the 2012 Colts Drum & Bugle Corps. He struggled through the ""Cornfield Tour,"" pushed himself even further still throughout the summer, and when the season concluded at the Colts annual awards banquet in November, his peers had voted him one of the two Most Improved Members of the brass section.</p>  <p>Dakotah returned in November 2012 to once again earn his position within the drum corps. He had a contract to be a member of 2013 Colts and was scheduled to move-in for summer over the Memorial Day weekend. His wonderful presence - on the field, on the bus, and in the hearts of his Colts brothers and sisters - will live on.</p>"

He is an innovator within the activity and helped create some of the most imaginative programs in DCI history. Marc joins returning Colts design team members Chris Tomsa (Brass Arranger), David Nelson (Percussion Arranger) and Brandon Smith (Guard Caption Head).</p>  <p>Marc has been teaching and designing visual programs for over 30 years. He began his career under the tutelage of George Zingali at the 27th Lancers. Together they moved to the Garfield Cadets in 1982 where they changed the visual landscape of the drum corps field. Prior to their arrival, the Cadets finished in the bottom half, or just outside, of DCI Finals for a decade. With George and Marc leading their visual program, the Cadets won three DCI World Championships in Marc's first four years with the corps. He joined the Star of Indiana staff for their first two seasons in 1986-87. Marc also worked with the Sky Ryders in 1987 on their popular ""West Side Story"" production, as well as Suncoast Sound in 1988.</p>  <p>For the past four seasons, Marc has been serving in a similar programming capacity with the Blue Knights.

Those who have been fortunate to see Marc Sylvester's shows remember the amazing speed and complexity of design he created on a football field. Beginning his teaching career with the 27th Lancers, Marc started by helping George Zingali put the dots on the paper. Over the years Marc began to develop techniques and mechanics of making the 'wild' ideas of Zingali a reality. Together they moved to The Cadets and continued their collaboration on outstanding drill. Designing and collaborating with Zingali, Marc learned the value of pushing the design concept to the edge and having faith in the performers to accomplish his vision. Marc continues to influence visual design as a consultant of many drum corps, color guards, and high schools. And his passion for the activity has not diminished. You may still find him writing drill, cleaning forms, painting props, or designing flags. He understands the value of entertainment, and clearly understands how important it is to ensure the performers are recognized for their efforts.""</p>"

This will afford Orwoll the opportunity to focus full-time on resource development while providing a more reasonable workload and time with his new family. ""After 28 years of being immersed in the day-to-day operations, this creates a much more manageable existence for me personally and makes resource development a higher priority for the organization, while providing a needed fresh spark for the Colts,"" said Orwoll.</p>  <p>Expanding her role as Youth Programs Director, which has included directorship of the Colt Cadets, Vicki Schaffer will add the Colts to her responsibilities.</p>  <p>Jeff MacFarlane will become interim Executive Director of the corporation, where he will be responsible for the day-to-day business operations of the organization. </p>  <p>""Vicki and Jeff have a great deal of experience and expertise that will allow them to grow and improve our day-to-day operations, while I will be able to devote all my energy to cultivating new and expanded relationships, support and opportunities in the Dubuque and drum corps community,"" Orwoll said. </p>  <p>The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps (a non-profit organization) sponsors the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps; Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps; Vocal Fusion, a youth performance ensemble; the Colts Summer Band; and PanRhythmiX and Pandemonium steel drum ensembles. Over 320 young people in grade two through age 21 participated in Colts programs.</p>  <p>The primary objective of the Colts Youth Organization is to provide programs for youth in music, performance and life skills training through a positive environment that emphasizes character and social development, leadership, self-discipline and the pursuit and achievement of excellence in the performing arts.</p>  <p><a href=""/documents/Orwoll_Colts_Restructure.pdf"">Click here</a> for a PDF of the press release.</p>"

39,2010,8,16,"What A Year! Colt Cadets Make Finals, Colts Miss By Just A Little","<p>The Cadets set records for themselves this year in placement and score and the Colts achieved a level of performance that captured the audience both days at finals and throughout the country during the summer. The Cadets were amazing all through the week and put on performances that were natural and exciting extensions of several years of stable yet dramatic improvement in all areas of their program. Congratulations to the staff and members of both corps on great and very, very successful seasons. Now, let the marching band season begin...</p>  <p>We at the Colts now unpack and begin next year all at the same time....</p>  <p>Today it feels a little overwhelming. Trucks full of instruments, food, uniforms and flags, and a vision are all we have to start with. Out of that will come an even more amazing experience for over 225 members of the Colts and Colt Cadets in 2011. We prepare to do it all over again, yet we prepare to do it all fresh and new. No two seasons are ever the same, (even comparing my 26 of them!) yet I am certain that no two seasons will be as different as 2010 compared to 2011 on many levels.</p>  <p>We're keeping the many things that work extremely well here exactly as they are, and we're taking a hard look at the areas we can and should do better. Excellence is a very demanding standard, yet it is what we strive for in every aspect of what we do. And while we can't use competition as the only, or even the most important measurement of our organizational excellence, it is important. In that area, particularly to the outside folks who are looking in, only one of our two programs was ""successful"".</p>  <p>We know that both corps were quite successful, and to finish where the Colts did requires an amazing drum corps full of amazing members, but to the outside world, the Cadets ""made it"". The Colts did not. While we do so many things so well, we have to do well, on a world-class level, compared to the very best in the world, in every area of our programs.</p>  <p>One of our goals for the Colts was to be in finals. We came up short. We were good enough to make finals, but so were others, and we were not good enough to make finals early enough in the season to have the inside track to a position. There are few surprises finals week, and frankly, the corps that made finals deserved to be in finals. But so did we. There just weren't enough slots in finals to accommodate all the corps that deserved it.</p>  <p>I have no doubt in my mind that the performance we put on in Semi Finals was over and away the finest performance in the history of the Colts. And probably better than any Colts finals performance in previous seasons. And I think the audience concurred. Congratulations. So, we didn't leave regrets and both of our corps were amazing, we have to be better every year in every area - on and off the field. And we will be. Starting today.</p>  <p>The 2011 season is here. It will look strikingly similar and strikingly different at the same time. It will be amazing. The hard work has already begun. Congratulations to our members, staff, volunteers and supporters on a tremendous season, and thank you for your trust and support. This year is your's to cherish forever. You earned that right.</p>  <p>Next year is now. Welcome!</p>"

33,2009,9,16,New Horizons Band Beginning in Dubuque!,"<p>Mike Grimes, Colts Operations Director, attended the introduction meeting hosted by John Woodin last Saturday, September 12th in the Colts Center. New Horizons Band is for beginning musicians, soon to be musicians and for seasoned-veteran musicians alike. If you have never played an instrument, but have the desire to learn, this program will be for you! The only catch? You must be at least 50 years old to join.</p>  <p>New Horizons Music is an international program that provides entry points to music making for adults, including those with no musical experience at all and also those who were active in school music programs but have been inactive for a long period. Many adults would like an opportunity to learn music in a group setting similar to that offered in schools, but the last entry point in most cases was elementary school. New Horizons undertands that for most of the last century, about 15 - 20 percent of high school students nationally participated in music. From that, they can estimate that at least 80 percent of the adult population needs beginning instruction in order to participate in making music. New Horizons Music programs serve that need.</p>  <p>Stop in during their Open House Saturday, September 26, from 11 am - 1 pm, at Kephart's Music Center on Hwy 20. Try out the band instruments and see what fits you best. Professionals will be there to help. You may purchase or rent to own arrangements may be made through Kepharts. Kepharts will even check out your old instrument to make sure it is still in playable condition.</p>  <p>Group Lessons Through the Northeast Iowa School of Music for seniors with no musical experience. Small group lessons will begin the first week in October. Nine one-hour lessons are only $95. There is a minimum of three students per group, with time/day arrangements to be made that best fits your schedule. When you feel you are ready to perform, you may join the band.</p>  <p>If you already play a band insrument you may join the band immediately! Weekly rehearsals are from 6:30 - 7:30 pm Monday evenings at the Colts Center downtown (1101 Central Ave.)Mr. John Woodin will be directing the ensemble. The cost is only $25 for the first 9 weeks, with the first rehearsal on October 5th.</p>  <p>What happens after the first 9 weeks? This is a pilot program, made possible through a grant from the City of Dubuque. New Horizons fully expects to keep this program going on after the holidays.

30,2009,7,2,Music On The March Sells Out!,"<p>For the first time ever, the stadium was a near sell out, with over 2,600 on hand. We have on hand ONE reserved seat ticket that was not sold, and general admission seats spilled into the grass on either side of the seating and even a few spectators sitting on the back side!</p>  <p>Music on the March has always been well attended, but always fell 300 to 500 seats short of a full stand.</p>  <p>The combination of the great line up (six of the top 15 in the world), cool pleasant weather, and the extra publicity the Colts have had all year from the Inaugural Parade, the chance to play for the annual Chamber of Commerce dinner and frankly a better job with promotions all came together.</p>  <p>The Colts and Cadets continue on tour from here and the Cadets now prepare for some local events in July culminating with Music on the March 2 on Friday, July 31 at Dalzell Field.</p>  <p>Thank you for your support!</p>"

""Unfortunately, as we found out this afternoon from a local news outlet, stadium construction officials have determined that the stadium will not be ready in time for our event this summer. We're a bit frustrated that we were 'scooped' on learning of this development, as we had no direct knowledge prior to the announcement that a change of venue was imminent.

Updated information will be released to corps directors and fans in the coming days regarding specific plans for the shift to the IU campus.

""Clearly, there are many issues that we're moving quickly to address, and we're appreciative of our loyal fans who continue to be patient as we work to create a championship experience worthy of the exceptional performers of Drum Corps International's outstanding units. We're confident that the 2008 World Championships week activities will serve as merely the latest chapter in a tremendous legacy, and will contribute to the foundation of a long and deeply rewarding relationship with the fine people of the state of Indiana.""</p>"
21,2007,12,17,Bianca Vocke Laid To Rest,"<p>If you have not had a chance to contribute to the fund raising efforts, please do so now. Both families face financial challenges, too. Thank you. You can make a donation via the Colts Store, as well. <a href=""/store/site/department.cfm?id=C42769F8-D61A-D555-D9052E3C0A73714E&killnav=1"">Click here</a> to make a contribution using your credit card on the Colts secure site.</p>  <p>TEXT OF HER EULOGY.</p>  <p>In Honor of Bianca Laura Jean Vocke</p>  <p>Notes from a remembrance delivered at her funeral on Saturday, December 15, 2007 by Greg Orwoll:<br> It is my honor to welcome you here this morning. I see in the entry way of this beautiful church this morning a poster for a program called 'Hands Around the World'. It reminds me of what Bianca has done. Her journey has been followed and she and her family have received support from literally around the world. It has been astounding, overwhelming and humbling. We see an internet site called 'facebook' an area called 'Pray for Bianca' that friends put up that now has over 1,200 members. There are 119 photos of Bianca posted on it. There are 338 messages for her and her family posted on it.</p> <p>As of this morning, I have received at the Colts office via our web site, and delivered to B and her family, 479 messages of support. They came from literally around the world. The emt who treated her at the accident site has called and sent his support and sympathy. The doctor who first treated her and stabilized her at the first hospital sent an email that was truly astounding  sending his sympathy, remarking on what an amazing young lady she must have been as he has followed our web site and facebook. He also included in his message a moving and powerful plea to young people everywhere, from his perspective that he asked that we share in her honor. We have and we will continue to distribute this message to young people far and wide. Each of the 300 young people who are here auditioning for the Colts this weekend have received a copy, with instructions to distribute it to everyone they know. It is a message and a lesson from B, and it will make a difference to many. Nurses who treated her are here from Iowa City. We had 14,000 visits to our web site from 17 countries in three days.</p> <p>Look at all of us here together today - Senior High and senior color guard. Friends and family from far and wide. Her Colts family. Did this incredible outpouring happen just because someone young and wonderful passed away tragically? Did this groundswell happen just because someone was in drum corps and color guard and high school? No. It happened because it was Bianca. I have no doubt that B was in charge this whole time, and I have no doubt that B brought us all together today for a reason. She also gave us the time we needed with her and with each other before she left. In these amazing letters I received for her and her family, I saw many constants:<br> Her smile<br> Her beautiful eyes<br> Her determination<br> Her talent<br> Her joy<br> Her courage<br> Her fight<br> Her drive<br> Her attitude<br> Her love of life<br> Her many important friendships<br> How she would light up a room with her smile and her personality<br> How show would light up a stadium with her presence and her performance<br></p>  <p>I was struck by the number of people who called her a best friend. I heard from a drum corps fan who, who when he saw her photo, recognized her immediately as the young lady he watched light up the entire Rose Bowl for him at DCI finals this summer. Bianca pulled together thousands of people in a common bond all over the world and made some amazing things happen. How many extra hugs between parents and children happened all over the world because of this and because of her? How many indestructible teenagers did she save by instilling a pause in them before they make a bad choice? How many broken relationships are being mended because of her reminder that life is short and life is fragile? I heard from a couple of people who did just that because of her lesson.</p> <p>She taught us to tell each other what we think and to value each other more. Bianca left each of us a better person for having known her. Her sister said a big worry she had was she didn't think she had many friends... Look around here. What can we learn from that? How did she not know? Think how many people she affected by her sheer joy of living. She was a star but she was too humble to believe it.</p>  <p> Bianca Vocke, 1990-2007 </p> <p>I read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend. He referred to the dates on her tombstone that mark the beginning and the end. He noted that first came the date that was her birth, and then spoke of the second date with tears. But he said what mattered most of all was the dash between the years. For that dash represents all the time that she spent alive on earth, and now only those who loved her know what that little line was worth. What matters is how we live and love and how we spend our dash. So think about this long and hard. Are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left that can still be rearranged. Perhaps be less quick to anger and quicker to show appreciation and friendship, and love the people around us as we have never loved them before. If we tell each other that we love them - and more often wear a smile - remembering that our special dash may only last a little while. When all is said and done, will you be proud of how you spent your dash?</p> <p>Bianca can be proud of how she spent her dash.</p> <p>It was my honor to get to know her family through this ordeal. I can see where she came from. To you all, our sympathies and thanks. Jean, Jay and John, you raised an amazing young lady who has affected and changed every person here. Thank you. All who knew her loved her, and all she knew she loved. Thank you Bianca for how you lived your wonderful life, and thank you for sharing it with us. When we think of Bianca and her short but amazing life, I'm sure what she would want us to think.</p> <p>Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.</p>"

18,2007,12,1,Two Colts Members Seriously Injured In Car Accident,"<p>Erin is in a hospital in Waterloo, Iowa with serious back and neck injuries plus other injuries. Bianca had to be air-lifted to The University of Iowa Hospitals overnight. I talked to Bianca's mother earlier this evening to be make sure we have the most accurate information possible...</p>  <p>Bianca's condition has improved from ""critical"" to ""critical but stable"" in the past 18 hours, but she is seriously injured, and her outcome is not yet certain. Your prayers are needed. Prayer and prayer groups make a difference. If you feel you can provide that support, please do so now. She is in an induced coma at this time and has undergone extensive emergency surgery for internal bleeding and injuries. She also has swelling on the brain. An MRI is being performed as I write this to determine the extent of any brain injuries she may have. She was responsive to her mom and others earlier today, which is very good news, but she is far from out of the woods.</p>  <p>I am convinced that people in a condition like Bianca's not only hear but respond to and benefit from messages that are read to them from friends and others. Please send me your best wishes for her and I will make sure that she hears them. I am planning to leave to see her at 2 p.m. on Sunday. Please send your message for her to greg@colts.org and I will get it to her and her family. Please do the same for Erin. She will have a long and difficult road to recovery as well.</p>  <p>Thank you. Life is very fragile. Please don't ever take it for granted. I love you all,<br>  Greg</p>"

14,2007,8,13,Wow! What An Experience!,"<img src=""/img/news/2007_banquet.jpg"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>As you know by now, The Colts made finals in Pasadena. We took 11th on both Thursday and Friday, and ended up 10th in finals. Random thoughts: I'm writing this from Emporia, KS outside a nice Starbucks while the 24 kids and drivers who remain with the buses wander off foraging for food.</p>  <p>Last night and today on the way home, I achieved my personal goal of sleeping through at least two states, and after a couple of overheating problems in Arizona yesterday, we are all intact and about 9 hours from Dubuque. My driving shift is due now, so I'll b helping to finish the drive from here to Dubuque.</p>  <p>We dropped about 90 off at LA Airports overnight Sunday morning, around 3 am., and I understand they all got out before the LAX computer crash. They are all back at ""real life"" already, hopefully reflecting on a summer of great accomplishments and personal breakthroughs.</p>  <p>In our final meeting following finals, I emplored them to now take what they have become and apply it to life. They are the top 1% and they have the obligation to change their worlds. We discussed their obligations to themselves and their world and that they have a finite amount of time in this world to truly make a difference. We even discussed what it takes and steps to take now to become wealthy in a financial way too. Not because of the trips to Cancun they can take but because it's their responsibility to be able to do things for others. An emotional final circle of members, staff, parents and volunteers experienced the closure of what has been the most amazing Colts season ever.</p>  <p>Members, please don't lose track of each other and please work hard to apply what you learned to everything you do. Parents, you now have a different human being for a son or a daughter. Support them in their newly found power to acheive and give them space to find out where they fit in ""in their other world"". It is a difficult transformation. They have new habits, new beliefs and new abilities. Help them as they find their new place.</p>  <p>To all, thank you! We had dozens of well wishers send notes via email, and they were all posted for the corps to read. It made a tremendous difference to us all. Thank you! To parents who were there to see this amazing adventure first hand, can you take a minute to let me know what you thought, and if it so moves you, to let the Dubuque community know through a letter to the editor? The Telegragh Herald has a web site - thonline.com that has a link for letters.</p>  <p>Help me continue to provide this experience. Our community probably now knows about the ""Top 10"" - and that's great, but they don't always understand what we do in the process, that is frankly more important. Your help in this would be a tremendous boost. So, through the tears, the sweat, the frustration, the breakthroughs, the standing ovations, the long bus rides, the Two Ocean Tour, and all the challenges that entailed, we have arrived at the end of the journey together. It was a great one.</p>  <p>I get tears now thinking of that last run through and that standing ovation from 300 of you for a full minute before they were done playing. I get choked up thinking of how long it took the kids to let go when they were dismissed after finals. I get a chill when I think of that full stadium standing ovation from 30,000 in the Rose Bowl, I still get a warm feeling when I think of the things the age outs said about this experience on Saturday.</p>  <p>But I am most proud and emotionally charged when I think of all the kids, and many parents, who ""got it"" this summer. Some amazing leaders of the future have been launched into the world this summer, and the world will be a better place for it.</p>  <p>Thank you all for your part in making the 2007 Colts the ride it was for us all.</p>"

5,2005,3,1,Colts Announce Drum Major,"<img src=""/img/news/2005_gervais.bmp"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>Ben Gervais, Drum Major</p>   <p><b>Where are you from?</b>  </p>  <p>I am from a lot of places. Originally born in Chicago, IL, I moved to   Stillwater, MN. Then to Fargo, ND then back to Minneapolis, MN. I then moved to Lenexa, KS where I have been for the past 7 years. </p>  <p><b>Where are you attending school?</b>  </p>  <p>Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, MO. </p>  <p><b>What is your major?</b>  </p>  <p>I am a percussion major studying music education. </p>  <p><b>How did you feel when you were selected the Colts drum major?</b>  </p>  <p>Overwhelmed. I was a bit nervous after hearing everyone cheer. However, it was not til after I was announced that Lauren Paul our Cymbal tech approached me for a hug. At that moment, I began to cry with the realization that I was never going to march cymbals again. She told me she was proud of me, which brought a smile to my face despite the tears. Ending on a happy note, I am very excited to be offered this position. </p>  <p><b>What can we expect from the Colts this season?</b>  </p>  <p>We have arrived. The Colts have been trying to define who they are and what they stand for. With a few changes and new additions, we are finally ready to unveil a legacy. More aggression and more intense emotional support will provide an exciting summer. I know for a fact that the other members and staff are excited about this summer. I feel it is a huge turning point for the Colts. Everyone is pumped up and ready to go out on fire.</p>  <p><b>What will you bring to the Colts as the drum major?</b>  </p>  <p>The staff is set, the show in place, and the members are ready to go. I plan on being intense and on fire from the very beginning. I plan on bringing into focus a high level of confidence for the Colts. Part of defining ourselves requires the confidence of the members portraying what it is they stand for. I will be there for every member when they need my help or encouragement. THIS is the year to be a Colt. Believe! </p>  <p><b>Tell us about your experience in the Colts.</b>  </p>  <p>My experience began in the summer of 2002 with the cymbal line. There were four rookies and one vet. It was a tough year, but we all came out on top as best friends. I had learned a lot from them, and most certainly a tons from Lauren Paul. My second summer (2003) was again with the cymbal line. We had three vets this time. This was the year we went to 6 in the cymbal line. I enjoyed my summer even more as a vet. I felt more aware of how to succeed individually and as a group. Lauren Paul again brought us to a brilliant success. Arriving into my third summer with the cymbal line was just amazing. We knew we were bringing back six out of six vets. That and a combination of Lauren ""Frau"" Pauls' mastery would make us real good. However, that summer provided different challenges than I expected. Towards the end of this summer, I had decided that I wanted to expand my marching experience. I had made the decision to audition for drum major. My reasoning did not go unjustified. It was a very hard decision for me to make, because I knew that if I made drum major, I would never march cymbals again. I have been through hard times and great times with the Colts. That organization and its contributors have made me who I am today.      </p>  <p><b>How has the Colts made an impact on your life?</b>  </p>  <p>The Colts have made many impacts on my life. I have met some amazing people in the Colts. I met my best friend, the love of my life, and many influential individuals along the way. Jeremy Meyer only marched in 2002 on timpani, but that began something I had no idea could happen. He helped me pick out the college I was to attend. At Northwest Missouri State University, Jeremy helped me grow as a person outside of tour. For those of you that know, 'tour' is a completely different realm then that of 'anything else but tour'. Jeremy and I quickly became best friends at college, and I will be his best man in his wedding this upcoming May. Loren Berry has provided much support to me on and off tour. I never have met anyone as compassionate as her before. She provides me a lot of the strength when I am down at school or on tour. Greg Orwoll is just an amazing motivational supporter. He helps out the organization non-stop. The cymbal line, Lauren Paul, and Ryan Thomas especially have helped me musically along the road. They are all amazing people that I will always cherish in my life. It makes a much more pleasurable marching experience if you trust the people that surround you, and I have had three amazing summers! </p>  <p><b>Is there anything else you would like to add?</b>  </p>  <p>""We were born ready!"" I am looking forward to being on the podium this summer. Being offered this position is a huge honor. I thank all the Colts members, staff, alumni, and volunteers for there relentless support. BELIEVE!</p>"
4,2005,1,25,Colts Volunteer Wins Top Scouting Award,"<img src=""/img/news/2005_bill.jpg"" alt="""" class=""alignleft imageborder""><p>""The Boy Scout motto is ""Be Prepared"","" said Bill Symoniak, an actively involved volunteer and parent for the Colts. Bill is also a Scoutmaster and recently saved the life of one of his Scout members during a trip in Black Hills, S.D. Because of this act, the top Scouting Award was presented to him. Bill states, ""I truly appreciate all the extra effort by the leaders in the Troop to make this Court of Honor and the presentation very special to me and my family. The presentation of the National Award of Merit was a surprise. I knew that the application had been submitted to the national headquarters, but I had no idea if it had been accepted or rejected. It was extra meaningful receiving the award from Pat.""</p>  <p>The Colts are proud that Bill is actively involved as a volunteer and parent for the Colts organization. We would like to recognize Bill for his outstanding heroic act and say thanks for all he does to impact the youth. Bill Symoniak currently serves on the Colts Corporation Board of Directors.</p>  <p>Pat Durham and his father Steve Durham expressed their gratitude for Scoutmaster Bill Symoniak's life-saving action in the summer of 2003. Symoniak revived Pat Durham after he collapsed and quit breathing while on a scout trip in the Black Hills, S.D. Symoniak was awarded the National Award of Merit by the Boy Scouts of America Nov. 29.</p>  <br>  <p><i>Following is the article as it appeared:</i></p>  <p><strong>Symoniak Wins Top Scouting award</strong> <i>by Sue Austreng, Life Editor</i></p>  <p>""On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight."" </p>  <p>With these words, Boy Scouts of America throughout generations and across the nation have pledged their desire to keep three promises: duty to God and country, duty to others, duty to self. Bill Symoniak has spent a lifetime living that pledge, and when his oldest boy was of Scouting age, he founded Troop 498 and has been its scoutmaster ever since. Nov. 29, the Boy Scouts of America acknowledged his dedication and service to God, to his country and to others with the National Award of Merit.  </p>  <p>His dedication and service are obvious to those who share his daily life: his wife and two Boy Scout sons, the boys in Troop 498 (the troop for which Symoniak is scoutmaster), his parents, his neighbors, his colleagues. Perhaps Symoniak's pledge to ""help other people at all times"" is most obvious to the family of Boy Scout Pat Durham.    On July 23, 2003, Symoniak saved Durham's life when Troop 498 visited Medicine Mountain Scout Camp in Custer, S.D.  </p>  <p>Kurt Krueger and Ed Eiffler, eyewitnesses to the account described the episode. The troop had spent the day in the Black Hills, visiting some of the monuments, rock climbing and touring Keystone. As they hiked back up to Mountain Scout Camp, Durham suddenly collapsed, falling face first onto the gravel road.  </p>  <p>""At first I thought he was playing. I think (Symoniak) thought the same thing,"" Eiffler said.   It was quickly determined that this was no joke, and Symoniak's life-saving instincts kicked in when he determined that Durham had stopped breathing and his eyes had rolled back in his head.   </p>  <p>Lifting Durham from the road, Symoniak performed a pelvic thrust and prepared to repeat it when Durham began breathing again.    Symoniak applied pressure to Durhams chin, which had split open when he collapsed, and other Scouts raced off to alert the camps medical staff.    Assistant Scoutmaster Steve Durham, the Scout's father, was several hundred yards away when his son collapsed and was unaware of what had happened.</p>  <p> ""I saw Bill tossing this guy up in the air. I didn't know it was Pat until I got closer. If it wasn't for Bill's instincts kicking in and doing what he did, I hate to think what might have happened,"" Steve Durham said.  </p>  <p>Steve took his son to the emergency room where Pat's vitals were checked, his chin was stitched and he was given fluids.    ""The doctor said Pat passed out due to the heat, the high elevation, some dehydration and the fact that Pat had had viral meningitis earlier that year,"" Steve Durham said. After giving him fluids and watching him for a while, they gave him a clean bill of health.    ""We returned to camp and two days later he ran in a race.""  After a follow-up examination, Durham was declared healthy and fit.  </p>  <p>The National Award of Merit was presented at the Court of Honor much to Symoniak's surprise. Assistant Scoutmaster Anne LeRoy organized the presentation ceremony without Symoniak's knowledge.    ""I knew if we told him we were doing this, he'd say we shouldn't,"" LeRoy said.   ""That what he did was just ""right time, right place."" He'd say anyone else would have done the same thing.""  As to the surprise factor, Steve Durham joked that ""this was payback.""  </p>  <p>""I sat next to Bill when he had a heart attack, then I see him throwing my son around,"" he said. ""This is payback. He'll be embarrassed to get this attention in front of everybody.""  </p>  <p>Troop 498 staged its quarterly Court of Honor Nov. 30 at Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Spring Lake Park. The Court of Honor proceeded in traditional style: a potluck dinner was shared, skits were performed, trivia questions were answered, boys were honored and merit badges were awarded. But throughout the evening, Steve Durham carried the glass-framed National Award of Merit concealed in a Fleet Farm bag.    And then special guests were introduced, including members of Boy Scouts of America's Viking Council, media personnel and Spring Lake Park Mayor Harley Wells.    Wells presented the Mayor's Proclamation declaring Nov. 29, 2004 ""Bill Symoniak Day in the city of Spring Lake Park.""    Mark Stensel, Viking Council representative, said, ""There are thousands of Scouts in Boy Scouts of America, and this award one is really, really unusual; really, really important.""    And then the announcement was made that Symoniak was awarded the National Award of Merit by the Boy Scouts of America.    ""We always just try to do what we can do. That's all I was doing,"" Symoniak said as he choked back tears and accepted the award.  </p>"
3,2005,1,6,Colts Announce 2005 Program,"<p>""POSTCARDS FROM HOME""</p>  <p>Imagine going through your grandmothers attic and finding faded postcards she had collected over the years. What would they tell you about what she treasured and the experiences she valued? What stories would they have? In their 2005 program, The Colts explore these possibilities and have selected four postcards from the collection.</p>  <p>Introducing and concluding this exploration is Aaron Coplands The Promise of Living from The Tender Land. This piece reflects the hope and promise of the Midwest experience. The first postcard pictures a Merry-go-round, a scene of youthful hope and joy. Coplands gift of The Red Pony reflects this upbeat optimism. The next postcard seen is Harvest. Alberto Ginasteras The Land Workers from his Estancia ballet portrays life on the farm, which is alternately ideal and punishing in its unrelenting dependence on the whims of nature and the physical demands of working the fields. Wish You Were Here is revealed in the third postcard which reflects personal relationships and the wistfulness that comes from being apart and the joy of being together. The Colts portray that sense of personal commitment through Meredith Wilsons soaring and lyrical ballad from the quintessential Midwestern musical theatre production of The Music Man: Till There Was You .The final postcard is State Fair. Months of toil and sacrifice are celebrated in the gathering at the State Fair. Reflecting this air of celebration are Aaron Coplands Stomp Your Foot and Morton Goulds Jubilee.</p>   <p>Take a few moments to go through an old picture album or collection of postcards or remembrances from your past and see what memories and emotions they stir. We believe you will find them as interesting and diverse as the cards we have collected.</p>"

As we worked with Yamaha, however, it became apparent that our two organizations were very much aligned and a perfect fit together."" said Greg Orwoll, Executive Director of the Colts. ""The decision to accept this offer from Yamaha was an easy one. Yamaha brings to our organization everything we need in terms of top-quality instruments, a strong commitment to education and exemplary service and support.""</p>  <p>The partnership goes beyond just the open-class Colts corps to include the Colt Cadets and other Colts-sponsored local programs as well.</p>  <p>""We're excited to get the chance to work with the entire Colts organization during the 2005 DCI season and beyond. Their commitment to music and youth is clear with the high quality of all their program offerings. From the Division I Drum Corps down to the younger student programs like the Dubuque Area Summer Band, it's clear that the entire Colts organization is a valuable partner with Yamaha in Music Education,"" said Kurt Witt, Yamaha's Marketing Manager for Wind Instruments.</p>  <p>Witt continued, ""There are a number of other corps that had expressed interest in playing Yamaha, but to be honest, we were really looking for quality rather than quantity. And with the addition of the Colts I feel like we've really got quality organizations in DCI playing Yamaha products.""</p>  <p>Orwoll expects to have the complete line of new Yamaha brass instruments, except tubas, in hand for the Colts audition weekend December 17-19 in Dubuque.
