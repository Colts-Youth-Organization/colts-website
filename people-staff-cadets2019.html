								<p class="no-margin-top">Performer and educator Stephen Lyons hails from Connecticut and is excited to join the design team of the Colt Cadets. He is returning to the Colts for a sixth season on their brass staff and has had the honored acquaintance with many of CC’s instructors and administrators during his most recent seasons on tour. He was introduced to the marching activity in the band as a student at East Lyme High School and through the Connecticut Hurricanes Drum & Bugle Corps. During his marching tenure with the Boston Crusaders Drum & Bugle Corps, which began in 2001, Steve designed drill by hand for his alma mater. Following his age out season in 2005 and one full tour with the Colts, he began an eight year tenure with 7th Regiment (New London, Connecticut) as their program coordinator and visual designer, during which he enjoyed being a part of many of the corps’ competitive and organizational milestones. Along the way, he has also worked as a marching and/or music instructor with the Connecticut Hurricanes Drum & Bugle Corps, Crossmen Drum & Bugle Corps, the Boston Crusaders Drum & Bugle Corps, and the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps. He currently teaches the U.S. Coast Guard Academy Windjammers Drum & Bugle Corps, King Philip Regional High School Marching Band, Norwalk High School Marching Band and Winter Percussion, and Cheshire High School Marching Band. During the day, he is an instrumental music teacher at Chase Collegiate School (Waterbury, Connecticut) and the Rectory School (Pomfret, Connecticut.)</p>
                                <p>Steve holds an Masters of Music in trumpet performance and an Artist’s Certificate in chamber music from UCONN. He earned his way through his masters program as an apprentice audio engineer, and is now happy to work in his limited free time in the field of recording and sound design for theater. Steve’s background in technology and music influences his approach to creating shows, as he strives for a healthy balance of aesthetic creativity and holistic functionality. He owes his accomplishments to many of the designers he has met while marching and instructing, and considers himself a lifelong learner and enthusiastic collaborator.</p>
