								<p class="no-margin-top">Jessica Coblentz is originally from Indiana, but has made a new home in northeast Iowa where she teaches and choreographs for performing arts groups across the state. As a performer herself, she marched four seasons with the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps from 2013 – 2016. Since aging out, Jessica has been returning each season to work with the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps color guard each summer. For her fourth returning year on staff, she will be stepping into the role of caption head, and could not be more thrilled for what's to come!</p>
                                <p>Jessica has worked with Anamosa High School since 2017 as their color guard director for the fall and winter seasons. She is also returning to the instructional staff of Crossroads Guard for a second year during the 2020 WGI season. She feels very blessed for the opportunity to work with many ensembles throughout the year, and spends the rest of her time expanding her knowledge around personal growth and fitness. Her biggest passion has become making color guard more accessible in the state of Iowa and across the Midwest!</p>

Samantha performed with the Colts color guard from 2012 to 2014, when she aged out as a soloist. She joined the Colt Cadets staff in 2016.</p>
                                <p>Originally from Davenport, Iowa, Samantha moved to Lincoln, Nebraska to attend the University of Nebraska—Lincoln, where she was a member of the Cornhusker Marching Band from 2011 to 2013. During this time, she also began teaching color guard for Norris High School, with whom she still works. In 2016, she graduated from the University of Nebraska’s honors program with a B.A. in English and minors in dance, French, and Arabic.</p>
