                <br>
                <p><b>CAMP PAPERWORK</b><br>
                Prior to camp, you will be expected to turn in:<br>
                <ul>
					<li><a href="rsvp.html" target="_blank">RSVP</a>. Regardless of your plans, submit an RSVP so we can keep you up to date. Be sure to include all necessary flight and travel information in the RSVP. If you need a ride from the airport, you will be notified by the Thursday immediately before the camp who will be picking you up. The RSVP should be submitted each month by interested students.</li>
					<li><a href="memberapp.html" target="_blank">Member Application</a>. Submit your application in advance to save time at check-in. All auditioning students <b>must</b> submit a member application. The application only needs to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes</li>
                    <li>Email a head shot of yourself to <a href="mailto:aidan@colts.org">aidan@colts.org</a>. Include your name (first and last), section, and which audition camp you are attending. This picture is added to your audition file so our instructional team can quickly learn your name and face. This picture must be submitted before the camp starts and is required of all attending. Make sure the image is clear, well lit, and contains your whole face. And, as great as your sunglasses or Snapchat filters may look, they don't belong in your head shot.</li>
				</ul>
                When you arrive to check in on Friday, bring with you:<br>
                <ul>
                	<li><a href="documents/MedicalForm2020.pdf" target="_blank">Colts Medical History Form</a>. This form is <b>required</b> in order to audition. The medical form also provides permission to participate in our activities. Students 18 or older may sign their own medical form. Any student 17 or younger must have a parent or guardian signature to participate. Medical forms only need to be submitted once per year, unless your information changes. Be sure to complete both sides!</li>
                </ul>
                <b>If this is your second camp, you do not need to submit an application, medical history form, or headshot (unless your information has changed). However, you will still need to submit an <a href="/rsvp.html" target="_blank">RSVP</a> for this camp.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Students stay overnight at the school on the floor, as you will all summer. Bring changes of clothes, shower supplies, towel, sleeping bag and pillow, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans), and tennis shoes (no high tops). Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. You will receive an audition t-shirt at check-in to write your name on that you will wear for all rehearsal segments of the weekend. <b>Don't forget to bring a water bottle!</b><br>
                <br>
                Brass: <b>Bring your own mouthpiece, marching instrument, music stand, binder for music, and gloves.</b> If you have absolutely no access to an instrument and need one provided, contact <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>. Be prepared to play the exercises and excerpts provided in the brass packet that best fits your area of interest. You may also demonstrate your abilities with any piece, etude, or excerpt you feel comfortable with. We will evaluate you individually, and as a part of the group.<br>
                <br>
                <p><b>MEMBERSHIP CONTRACTS</b><br>
                Limited positions are open in the brass line. Following the weekend, you will receive 1) an offer of membership, 2) a recall for a second audition, or 3) a suggestion to come back again next year or to consider Colt Cadets. Most will receive a recall to a second rehearsal, so please plan accordingly. Recall auditions can be scheduled three weeks after your initial audition at one of our events. Attend early and attend often for your best chance at a position in the Colts.<br>
				<br>
                If this is your second rehearsal, we are specifically looking for the growth you have made in the past month. Your audition will be very similar to the prior month, so be prepared in the same manner as which was asked for your first audition. A decision will be made regarding your membership after this camp. If you cannot attend this camp, make sure you are communicating with the office and your caption head about when you will be here.<br>
                <br>

                Individuals offered a contract should begin making payments on your fees immediately when you submit your contract. If you cannot attend this rehearsal, you must be in touch in advance to preserve your position in the corps. Initial contract offerings are valid until noon on Saturday of this rehearsal. We must have a signed contract with initial payment by that time, or the spot will be released to someone else. You can pay your fees by cash or check, or by card online at the <a href="http://store-colts-org.3dcartstores.com/Summer-Fees_c_29.html" target="_blank">Colts Mall.</a></p>
                <br>
				<p><b>SCHEDULE CONFLICTS</b><br>
Camp attendance is critical to our and your success. If you cannot attend this rehearsal but are planning to attend an upcoming audition, you must be in touch in advance through the <a href="rsvp.html">RSVP</a>. It is important to communicate with your caption head as well. Too much communication is better than not enough.<br>
<br>
If you have schedule conflicts with our preseason rehearsals, talk with us. Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all. Do not lose your opportunity to perform with the Colts over a lack of communication.</p>
               <br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                There is no parent meeting scheduled for this event, but Vicki, Aidan and Rich will be available Friady night and throughout the weekend to answer any questions you may have about Colts or Colt Cadets. Schedules will be available at the check-in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend. If you arrive at a random time throughout the weekend, the kitchen or check-in table are great places to start with questions anytime you visit about where you can help.<br>
		<br>
		Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colts successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colts experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet other parents, and get comfortable with what this is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here.<br>
		<br>
		Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work and construction projects at the corps warehouse. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand!<br>
        <br>
        Parents are welcome to stay overnight in designated rooms at Roosevelt Middle School  with sleeping bags and air mattresses. If parents are interested in hotel accommodations, we recommend the <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/dbqiahx-hampton-dubuque/" target="_blank">Hampton Inn</a>, as we can offer a special rate of $91.00 per night. To receive the rate, call <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a>, ask for the front desk and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate. Auditioning students are expected to stay with the group overnight at the school. As always, email or call us with any questions you may have.<br>
