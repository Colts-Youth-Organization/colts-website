								<p class="no-margin-top">Mitchell R. Stolberg will be returning to the Colts Youth Organization as color guard designer and caption head for the Colt Cadets 2018 season. He holds a Bacherlor's in dance from the University of Iowa. Mitchell began participating in the marching arts in high school with Dubuque Senior High School color guard in 2005.

While he loves performing, Mitchell's true passion lies in teaching, and he began pursuing this as a movement technician by choreographing for the Xavier High School color guard in 2008 and 2009. He moved on to teach, design, and choreograph for the Downers Grove South High School color guard from 2010 - 2013, and then worked as a guest clinician at the 2013 Iowa State University Winter Guard Spin Clinic in Ames, Iowa.</p>

While at the Rockford Dance Company, Mitchell taught a multitude of classes, varying from beginner level to advanced technique in ballet, modern, and jazz dance. Outside of teaching, he choreographed six new concert dances for the RDC Performing Company and assisted in the re-staging of classical ballets, including <i>The Nutcracker</i> and <i>Swan Lake</i>. Mitchell performed the principal roles of Godfather Drosselmeyer in <i>The Nutcracker</i>, Lysander in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and the male lead in <i>Salute America</i>.

                                <p>In August 2015, Mitchell began teaching at Rockford University as an adjunct dance professor, and is continuing through his third year as a faculty member.

								<p class="no-margin-top">Mitchell R. Stolberg will be returning to the Colts Youth Organization as color guard designer and caption head for the Colt Cadets 2018 season. He holds a Bacherlor's in dance from the University of Iowa. Mitchell began participating in the marching arts in high school with Dubuque Senior High School color guard in 2005. At the end of his first year, Mitchell went on to march drum corps with the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps in 2006 and 2007, then marched with Colts Drum & Bugle Corps in 2008 and 2009. While he loves performing, Mitchell's true passion lies in teaching, and he began pursuing this as a movement technician by choreographing for the Xavier High School color guard in 2008 and 2009. He moved on to teach, design, and choreograph for the Downers Grove South High School color guard from 2010 - 2013, and then worked as a guest clinician at the 2013 Iowa State University Winter Guard Spin Clinic in Ames, Iowa.</p>
                                <p>After graduating from the University of Iowa in 2013, Mitchell joined the faculty of the Rockford Dance Company and moved into the role of school director until May 2016. While at the Rockford Dance Company, Mitchell taught a multitude of classes, varying from beginner level to advanced technique in ballet, modern, and jazz dance. Outside of teaching, he choreographed six new concert dances for the RDC Performing Company and assisted in the re-staging of classical ballets, including <i>The Nutcracker</i> and <i>Swan Lake</i>. Mitchell performed the principal roles of Godfather Drosselmeyer in <i>The Nutcracker</i>, Lysander in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and the male lead in <i>Salute America</i>. He has also taught jazz master classes in the Rockford Public School District's CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) Dance Academy and developed his first evening length ballet entitled <i>The Ugly Duckling</i> at The Nordlof Center in downtown Rockford, Illinois.</p>
                                <p>In August 2015, Mitchell began teaching at Rockford University as an adjunct dance professor, and is continuing through his third year as a faculty member. During his first year as a professor, Mitchell was given the amazing opportunity to teach an intermediate level jazz dance class at the 2016 American College Dance Association's Central Conference at Anderson University in Anderson, Indiana. When he is not teaching at Rockford University, Mitchell is still performing as a fifth year company member with Bad Wolf Dance Theatre under artistic director Amy A. Wright, as well as dancing with Without Shoes Modern Dance Company under artistic director Maria Castello. Mitchell is also currently on staff at Allegiance Winter Guard as a dance and rifle technician under the direction of Eric Hall in Dundee, Illinois.</p>
                                <p>Mitchell is beyond excited to work with Colt Cadet Director David Alford and Color Guard Supervisor Jessica Dunkel, and is so grateful for the opportunity with the Colts organization!</p>

After aging out, Jessica joined Colt Cadets staff in 2009 and has been a "weekend warrior" with the corps since.</p>
