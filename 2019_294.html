                <p><i>September 27, 2019</i></p>
                <p>Rich Waddington has been named director of the Colt Cadets Drum & Bugle Corps. Rich brings with him nearly 20 years of teaching band in public schools throughout the state of Iowa. Most recently, Rich was the director of bands at Oskaloosa High School in southeast Iowa. The program enjoyed many years of success in its rich history in all areas, including marching band, concert band, and jazz band. Rich joined the team at Oskaloosa in 2011. Prior to Oskaloosa, Rich was a band director for Bondurant-Farrar Community Schools for 11 years. A native of the Minneapolis suburbs and a graduate of Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, Rich brings with him a strong background in education based around individual student success. Rich will also be taking over the role of accountant and handling the financial aspects of the Colts Youth Organization.</p>
                <p>"I’m proud to be part of an organization with such a rich history of music education throughout the state of Iowa," said Rich. "Growing up watching drum corps, I always wanted to be part of something special and now I have the opportunity. I look forward to working with great people!"
                <p>“I was beyond excited when Rich accepted the offer to join our full-time staff,” said Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. “His experiences as a high school band director, along with two years as Colt Cadets tour director, make Rich very well prepared to step into the role of corps director. We’re excited for the momentum of the Colt Cadets program that is sure to benefit from the respect Rich had among his former colleagues in the Iowa marching band community."</p>
                <p>Rich first came to the Colt Cadets in the spring of 2018, when his two children — Carter and Morgan — were interested in joining the corps. He and his wife, Angie, were active volunteers with the corps for several months, helping in the sewing room, the kitchen, and with general construction projects. Rich was also asked to take on the role of tour director for the 2018 season. He continued this role in 2019, working closely with Andrew Eaton and Alex Albertson on the Colt Cadets leadership team. Following the summer season, he and his family moved to Dubuque, allowing Rich to accept a full time position with the Colts. The whole family has been active with the Colt Cadets since 2018 — Carter in the bass line, Morgan in the front ensemble, and Angie leading many volunteer projects for sewing and cooking. The whole family is looking forward to many more seasons of fun with the Colts organization!</p>
                <p>Andrew Eaton and Alex Albertson will continue to have key roles with the Colt Cadets in 2020. Andrew will assist the brass team and Alex will continue working with percussion, while both will continue providing valuable perspective and ideas on the design team.</p>
                <p>"The Colt Cadets team keeps getting stronger and stronger!" said Director Of Youth Programs Vicki MacFarlane. "The wealth of experience Rich brings is tremendous for all the members and our full organization. Colt Cadets have such a strong identity and important role in the Drum Corps International community by providing an access point for all students, and at an earlier age than most corps allow. We are excited to have Rich with us full time and continuing to develop the Cadets program."</p>
                <p>Colt Cadets will begin rehearsals in the spring, but students ages 14 or older interested in being a part of the Colt Cadets are encouraged to attend a Colts rehearsal weekend for experience.  More information about joining Colt Cadets will be posted in the winter — including rehearsal schedule, 2020 general membership information, and more!
