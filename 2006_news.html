		</div>
	</div>
    		    <p><i>December 1, 2006</i></p>
                <p>EQUINOX</p>
                <p>Great music from the worlds of the Symphony Hall, Broadway Stage, and Cinema Screen converge to create EQUINOX  - the Colts adventure through seasons of snow, ice and starry nights.</p>
                <p>In what promises to be their most exciting production to date, the corps takes the 2007 audience on a wild ride filled with color and emotion.  Nature's kaleidoscope holds the key to the show's vivid hues and high energy, from the deep intrigue of Bartok's angular rhythms, to the melodic grandeur of Andrew Lloyd Webber. Joyous and bittersweet, the power, intellect, and passion of the Equinox are captured in an instant.</p>
                <p>The first audition weekend for the Colts is December 15-17 at Roosevelt Middle School in Dubuque. Further information and an application is available at www.colts.org or by calling 563-582-4872.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts To Open For The Charlie Daniels Band</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
    		    <p><i>May 10, 2006</i></p>
                <p>The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps is pleased to announce that they have accepted an invitation to open for the world-famous Charlie Daniels Band on Friday, June 9, 2006, in Dubuque, IA.</p>
                <p>The Charlie Daniels Band is scheduled to perform as center stage main concert at the 2nd Annual "America's River Festival" to be held the weekend of June 9-11, 2006, at the Port of Dubuque. The Colts have arranged to be in town for the concert, as part of their summer-long tour that begins Memorial Day and continues full-time through August 12.</p>
                <p>This concert is in addition to several other local and area performances that include a guest appearance with the Dubuque Symphony Orchestra on their Independence Pops Concert on July 1, and the Colts annual Music on the March competition on July 7.</p>
                <p>"What a great opportunity for our members and staff to share the stage with such an amazing performer. We anticipate we will perform for approximately 2,500 people in this setting, and we will be able to take the rest of the night off to enjoy the Charlie Daniels concert and the festival as well," said Greg Orwoll, Colts Executive Director.</p>
                <p>The other main event concert as part of the festival will be the multi-platinum rock group, Styx. Eight other regionally-known bands will perform as well throughout the weekend. Other events include the ESPN "Dock Dog" Competition and the ESPN Outdoors "Bassmasters" Fishing Tournament. The Stihl Timbersports Series will hold a competition for ESPN taping, and Extreme Motocross will hold a competition as well.</p>
                <p>Over 12,000 people are expected to attend the festival, and 2,500 are expected for the main event concerts, including the Colts performance.</p>
