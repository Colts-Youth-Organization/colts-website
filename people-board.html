Throughout the past 14 years, she has traveled the country performing as a Marine musician and providing mentorship and leadership to her Marines as section and ensemble leader, Platoon Sergeant, Supply Chief, Purchaser and Administrative Chief.</p><p>LeAnn first became aware of drum corps during high school, but it wasn\'t until the 2001 season that she sought out information on participating and found a home at the Colts. LeAnn played 2nd soprano for the 2001 and 2002 seasons, and then came to the January camp in 2003 to help out wherever needed. Drafted by other 2002 ageouts on the visual staff to drive them to the Corps hall, she found herself included in a meeting and was asked if she wanted to come on tour and teach with the visual team. Thus started a four year adventure of teaching, life lessons, and even building props with family that certainly had a huge impact on her success as a Marine. Although unable to spend much time with the Colts since enlisting in 2006, LeAnn was able to assist with coordinating the Colts Alumni Corps performances for the 50th Anniversary in 2013, dubbed the Tour Director on the "Tour to Nowhere."</p>',
