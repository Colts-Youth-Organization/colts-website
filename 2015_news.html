            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Name Noah Perkins Drum Major For 2016 Season</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <img src="img/news/2015_perkins.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
      <p><i>November 19, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>A fifth-year member from the brass section, Noah Perkins will gain a new perspective on the drum corps activity from the perch of the Colts podium. Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane and Program Coordinator Howard Weinstein are confident Noah's character and leadership qualities are a perfect fit for the job left vacant by recent age outs Kara Metzger and Cole Hanton.</p>
                <p>To gain a better understanding of the 2016 Colts leader, we recently asked Noah to share a little bit about himself, his love of music, and his belief in the Colts.</p>
                <p>My name is Noah Perkins. I'm 19 years old studying trombone performance at the University of Iowa, and a four-year member of the Colts baritone section. I also marched four seasons in high school, and one season in college with the Hawkeye Marching Band. I am incredibly honored to be named drum major, and cannot wait to see what the future has in store for the Colts.</p>
                <p>As a senior in high school, I saw Wycliffe Gordon and his combo live at a jazz club in Iowa City. The raw energy and passion he performed with changed my outlook on music entirely. I had heard repeatedly in drum corps and elsewhere that music is about "making the audience feel something," and seeing Wycliffe was when I truly realized what that meant.</p>
                <p>I was taken to drum corps shows at a very young age although I have no memory of them. My dad marched six years with the Troopers. In 2011, I went to a drum corps show in Davenport, Iowa, and knew then I had to give it a try. My parents have always been supportive. I share the drum corps experience with my sister who has been a member of the Colt Cadets color guard since the time I joined Colts. It's a connection we share that a lot of siblings don't get to. We have definitely grown closer as a result.</p>
                <p>My outlook on the activity has changed notably with every passing summer. In the first and even second summers, everything was incredibly exciting and a bit overwhelming. To be honest, I struggled during those years and it's helped me become who I am today. During my third season I learned to relax and enjoy the ride while still working desperately to be excellent. Last summer taught me a lot about what I want in life, and how to push myself even when I think I've hit my limit.</p>
                <p>I can't wait to work with the group of educators and designers on Colts staff in 2016, especially those with such excellent track records. The brief time I've spent with Howard has already changed my perspective on drum corps and what it can do for us as individuals. I'm also looking forward to the change from marching member to drum major, and facing a new set of challenges and experiences. I am truly honored to be part of the legacy of Colts drum majors, and I cannot wait to see how excellent the corps can be this season.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Hand Program Reins To DCI Veteran Howard Weinstein</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>September 7, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts Youth Organization announced today that Howard Weinstein will lead the Colts design team in 2016. Howard has a long history in the drum corps activity as both program coordinator and corps director. His two most recent DCI stops have been with the Boston Crusaders (1999-2007) and the Blue Stars (2009-2011).</p>
                <p>Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane is thrilled by the hire. "Howard and I first got to know each other when we served together on the DCI Board of Directors," said Vicki. "I've always been impressed with the leadership qualities he instills in the groups he works with. We just became a better organization today  and a better drum corps  with Howard on our staff."</p>
                <p>Howard has been a music educator for the past 28 years. He works with many high school programs in Florida and Georgia including Tarpon Springs, the 2014 Bands of America Grand National Champions. He is excited to begin building on the recent momentum of the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps.</p>
                <p>"The Colts are wonderfully positioned to make a strong statement in 2016," said Howard. "They have a growing popularity throughout DCI, and a great reputation in the activity for providing a terrific member experience. Vicki and I are assembling a solid team of designers and educators, and we're ready to get down to business."</p>
                <p>Watch for additional announcements on the Colts design and caption heads coming soon. The organization's annual Awards & Recognition Banquet is scheduled for Friday, November 27th at the Five Flags Center in Dubuque, Iowa, followed immediately by the first audition weekend of the 2016 season. </p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>September 7, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts Youth Organization is pleased to announce it has received a $30,000 grant from the City of Dubuque as part of the City Council's Arts & Culture Grant Program for Operating Support.

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">A Great Trumpeter, Colts Fan, And Father Leaves The Stage At 83</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <img src="img/news/2015_bud.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
      <p><i>July 28, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>On Sunday, July 26, 2015, the Colts were left with a trumpet hole and this time around there would be no replacement. Bud MacFarlane was a wonderful man. He entertained thousands through the years with his musicianship, and I would like to use this opportunity to tell the world a little bit more about him.</p>
                <p>Bud had a subtle delivery on the trumpet. From Dixieland to big band to the families' holiday favorites, his syncopated style was smooth as butter on a warm day. His tone was pure unless slightly bent to add a bit of style. He also sang the likes of Frank Sinatra and Bobby Darin with a mellow sound that pulled you onto the dance floor. He rarely took center stage although he had all the skills if asked to do so. For more than two decades he was part of The Country Kings, although the group played little country. Instead, they had a big band sound with all the instrumentation and were among the most popular acts at dance halls throughout the Midwest in the '60s and '70s. I was always proud to watch him perform.</p>
                <p>My oldest sister, Jane, joined the Colt .45 Drum & Bugle Corps in 1969 at the urging of her friends at Wahlert High School. There she would one day meet her husband of 42 years, Jim Kohl. My Dad would soon be driving the family all over the country to watch the group compete. Shortly after, my older siblings joined her as I waited anxiously to reach the required age of 11 to join the Colt Cadets. By 1973, all four of my older siblings were members of the Colt .45 and I was a Colt Cadet. We were a drum corps family. Somehow my Dad managed to see many shows between his regular job and the band gigs he played most every Saturday night. He remained a drum corps fan through the years although he preferred the older style with songs covered more closely to their original arrangement. He loved the patriotic tunes. Watching the San Antonio regional on Pay Per View, he told me his idea for the greatest drum corps show of all time. I'm not sure it had everything the judges look for these days but I'm pretty sure he was right that audiences everywhere would rise to their feet in appreciation. And for that, Bud, we rise to our feet to salute you.</p>
                <p>My Dad was creative, a problem solver, an artist in many sorts of ways, and a diligent worker. He was meticulous is every endeavor whether fine-tuning his golf game or shaving a sliver off his wood working project to get everything just so.</p>
                <p>He was a quiet man who preferred to lead by example rather than with words. He treated those around him with respect, and he lived with a level of integrity that will always be the standard I aspire to. He shared love in the simplest ways....often with a subtle wink of an eye that let you know he was with you in mind, body and spirit. He was absolutely best friends with his wife, Ruth ("Cookie"), with whom he celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary in May.</p>
                <p>There was a television advertisement some time ago that said, "Like Mike...if I could be like Mike," after the great NBA star Michael Jordan. As I continue my journey through life, I can only hope to wake each day and pursue my goal to be "Like Bud....if I could be like Bud."</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking a minute of your time to learn about my Dad.</p>
                <p>Arrangements for Gerald J. "Bud" MacFarlane are being made at the Miller Funeral Home in East Dubuque, Illinois. More information is available <a href="http://www.millerfhed.com/home/index.cfm/obituaries/view/fh_id/14001/id/3254930">HERE</a>.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Receive $10,000 Grant From Dubuque Racing Association</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <img src="img/news/2015_red_zone.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
      <p><i>July 10, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>When the Dubuque Racing Association announced their grant awards to local nonprofit organizations just before summer, the Colts Youth Organization was pleased to learn it received $10,000 for the rebranding of the Colts Merchandise Marketplace -- a transformation of our souvenir operation from a concessions-style trailer to a pop up tent with display racks.</p>
                <p>The new configuration allows customers to have a more interactive buying experience thereby boosting sales. This was the 19th consecutive year that the Colts received a grant of $5,000 or more from the DRA.</p>
                <p>The Red Zone made its debut at the Colts Summer Premiere at the University of Dubuque's Chalmers Field on Thursday, June 18th.</p>
                <p>While it's hard to project the exact impact on sales, the upgraded marketplace will do a better job of positioning the Colts brand in the crowded corps merchandise areas. The corps also sees the Red Zone as an opportunity to increase recruiting as well among musicians and performers who will be looking to join a drum corps in 2016.</p>
                <p>The Dubuque Racing Association (DRA) is the nonprofit license holder for the Mystique and Diamond Jo casinos. Grants have been offered to area nonprofit organizations through a competitive submission process since 1985.</p>
                <p>Last year, the Colts received a $12,500 grant from the DRA for the purchase of percussion equipment for the Colts Cadets.</p>
                <p>The two years prior, the DRA awarded the Colts the maximum amount offered with $40,000 in 2012 to purchase all-new uniforms for both the Colts and Colt Cadets, and $25,000 in 2013 for the completion of a new roof on the Colts Center at 11th & Central in downtown Dubuque.</p>
                <p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $350,000 for new instruments, uniforms, vehicles and trailers, computers and other equipment, and building improvements.</p>
                <p>Thank you to the DRA for continuing to support the vision of the Colts Youth Organization and our mission to "use music & excellence to teach other about success in life."</p>

      <p><i>July 9, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts Summer Band will conclude their summer lesson series with a concert at the Alliant Energy Amphitheater on Thursday, July 9 at 7:00 pm. The Colts Summer Band will be joined by our Pandemonium Steel Drum Ensemble and the Colt Cadets.</p>
                <p>Directors of the summer band are Brian Enabnit and Dan Norman. The four week program includes ensemble rehearsals and sectional lessons, and has grown to 55-60 students for each of the past few summers.</p>
                <p>The Colt Cadets are thrilled to rejoin the summer band after last year's scheduling conflict. The drum corps will perform their 2015 program, "Fire & Ice."</p>
                <p>Pandemonium will begin the evening with their blend of calypso and pop hits. They are the older of the two steel drum ensembles sponsored by the Colts Youth Organization.</p>
                <p>The event is FREE and open to the public!</p>

      <img src="img/news/hof.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
      <p><i>April 8, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts are now accepting nominations for their Hall of Fame class of 2015! Any member of the public may nominate an individual for induction into the Colts Hall of Fame by submitting a letter describing the reasons their nominee should be considered, along with a brief description of the role and history of contributions that person has made to the Colts organization. <a href="http://www.colts.org/HOF_Nomination.pdf">CLICK HERE</a> for a description of the nomination process.</p>
                <p>The Hall of Fame was established in 1993 during the 30th anniversary celebration of the Colts. The award is the highest level of recognition given by the organization, and many of our founding fathers were the first to be enshrined. The Hall of Fame went dormant following our 40th anniversary but the time is long overdue to reenergize this proud tradition, and continue to honor those who have provided distinguished service.</p>
                <p>In the days ahead, we will expand the recognition of the individuals currently included in the Hall of Fame by adding a brief biography and photograph for each. If you have photographs, anecdotes, or other information to add to Hall of Fame member biographies, please send them to: <a href="mailto:hof@colts.org">hof@colts.org</a>. You can view a full listing of all Colts Hall of Fame members <a href="http://www.colts.org/hof.asp">HERE</a>.</p>
                <p>Act now as 2015 nominations are due by May 15th!</p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>March 20, 2015</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps follows up its innovative 2014 production with another adventure into the conceptual blend of drum corps and theatrical arts. Their 2015 program titled, <i>"...And A Shot Rings Out: A Johnny Staccato Murder Mystery,"</i> features music from Elmer Bernstein <i>(Man with the Golden Arm)</i>, Michael Daugherty <i>(Lex from "Metropolis Symphony")</i>, Christian McBride <i>(Science Fiction)</i>, Charles Mingus <i>(Moanin')</i>, original music by Chuck Naffier and David Nelson, and a stunning ballad based on Grammy-sensation Sam Smith's <i>Lay Me Down.</i></p>
                <p>"We took an unusual path with last year's show," said Storyteller Wayne Harris. "It took some time for fans to embrace the journey with us but once they did, we had a magical walk together into the Emerald City."</p>
                <p>"We're gonna continue to define who the Colts are, while we look at new ways to deliver a drum corps performance," said Program Coordinator Marc Sylvester. "It's film noir. It's fresh. It's something nobody's done. But in the end, our plan is just to be a really good drum corps."</p>
                <p>The Colts debut their 2015 program along with the Colt Cadets at their Summer Premiere on June 18th at the University of Dubuque's Chalmers Field. The competitive season begins on June 20th in Grandville, Michigan, and concludes at the Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis in early August. </p>
