Students only need to submit one member application for the sesaon, unless your information changes.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>WHAT TO BRING</b><br>
                Students will stay overnight in the gym on the floor, like they do all summer. Bring changes of clothes (we recommend layered athletic clothing), shower supplies, towel, comfortable clothes for rehearsal (no jeans), tennis shoes (no high tops), and a water bottle. Many students will bring an inflatable mattress with a battery-powered air pump. Bring a binder with plastic sleeves for your music and any hand-outs. Layers of clothes means t-shirt, shorts, wind or sweat pants, sweatshirt, and light jacket. Tennis shoes are a must!<br>
                <br>
                <b>Brass:</b> Bring your own mouthpiece, music stand, and binder for music, if you are able. We will have extra mouthpieces and stands at the camp if you don't have your own. We will provide all instruments for the weekend. You may bring your own marching instrument if you would like.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Percussion:</b> Bring your own sticks or mallets and practice pads, if you are able. We will provide all instruments for the weekend.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Color Guard:</b> We will provide all flags, rifles, and sabres, but you can bring your own if you would like. Bring lightweight, workout clothing for rehearsals (no jeans).</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>PARENTS</b><br>
                An informational meeting will be held Friday evening at 8:45 PM in a location to be announced. Bring all of your questions! Schedules will be available at the check-in table with locations for everything going on throughout the weekend.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are strongly encouraged to attend the weekend. Parental support is what makes the Colt Cadets successful, and you are needed to give the kids the incredible Colt Cadets experience we are known for. Also, this is the best way for you to find out about our program, meet the other parents, and get comfortable with what drum corps is all about. You will find a very welcoming and exciting opportunity here. Parents will cook and serve the meals throughout the weekend, coordinate sewing projects, and assist with some repair work. We always have things to do for anyone willing to lend a hand. The Colt Cadets staff will also be available throughout the weekend to answer any questions you may have about the drum corps experience, what we do, and how we do it.<br>
                <br>
                Parents are welcome to bring a sleeping bag and sleep in a classroom at the school or stay in a hotel. For all events, we recommend the <a href="https://hamptoninn.hilton.com/en/hp/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DBQIAHX" target="_blank">Hampton Inn</a> for your stay in Dubuque. Please call the hotel directly at <a href="tel:5636902005">563.690.2005</a>, select the front desk, and ask for the Colts Drum Corps rate. Students are expected to stay with the group overnight at the school. As always, email or call with any questions you may have.<br>

                <br>
                <p><b>WEEKEND SCHEDULE</b><br>
                A snack before bed will be provided on Friday night after rehearsal. Four meals will be provided on Saturday, and a breakfast and sack lunch will be provided on Sunday. We will eat off of the Colt Cadets food truck (affectionately called the "Chuck Wagon") just like we do on tour!<br>

If you are unable to attend the whole weekend, you are definitely still welcome to participate! Attending part of the weekend is better than not attending at all.

                <p><b>SOUVENIRS</b><br>
