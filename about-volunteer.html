						<p>Volunteers are needed for the Colts and Colt Cadets during camps, spring training, and on tour to give these great kids the support they need and deserve! It takes a lot to make sure two drum corps run smoothly, and we need your help to make sure that it happens! The only qualification needed is your willingness to give your time and talent to support what we do! You can be a parent, an alum, a supporter, or a friend. You're qualified to help!</p>
                        <p><strong>Sign up today! We start filling the calendar as soon as the schedule is known and are usually looking for help on nearly all days of the summer!</strong><br>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>For Colts, please contact Bill Symoniak, Volunteer Coordinator, at <a href="mailto:volunteers@colts.org">volunteers@colts.org</a>, or Vicki MacFarlane, Colts Director, at <a href="mailto:colts@colts.org">colts@colts.org</a>, to get on the schedule. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSMqoZYJpc97nPxkBkaOAFf_sIXTQJ4g0gUWKaXrceSURdyC1Kdl69UWrWpizmq8q_aSQUcGG8Senzr/pubhtml" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view the Colts Volunteer Calendar for this season.</li>
                            
                            
                        	<li>For Colt Cadets, please contact Rich Waddington, Colt Cadets Director, at <a href="mailto:rich@colts.org">rich@colts.org</a> to get on the schedule. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS88GgPsIfzqaqjOfZpDwSCSaZha4zR0n_RPCNBmMP47wxs1YbxPSlOVoX_wS9PDd_beT3obSioUUca/pubhtml" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view the Colt Cadets Volunteer Calendar for this season.</li></li>
                        </ul>
                        </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>To those of you who help at camps or are already on the calendar, we send a giant THANK YOU! See you there!</p>
                                <p>The best advice we can offer people to prepare for travel is covered in the <a href="documents/coltsvolunteerhandbook_2019.pdf" target="blank">Colts Volunteer Manual</a> or the <a href="documents/cadetsvolunteerhandbook_2019.pdf" target="blank">Cadets Volunteer Manual</a>. If you are planning to travel with the Colts or Colt Cadets this summer, please read the volunteer handbooks. The volunteer manual gives a good overview, but the best way to understand it is to experience it! T</p>
								<p>We will prepare and serve around 800 meals a day for Colts and around 400 meals a day for Colt Cadets, travel thousands of miles for 70+ days this summer, from Memorial Day through DCI finals in Indianapolis, and sew and alter over 200 uniforms multiple times a summer. We take pride in providing one of the best volunteer programs in the activity. It's not convenient and it's not easy. But it's also not to be missed. No matter what it takes, find a way to volunteer. Ideally, try to arrange for a week, which quite often makes logistics easier, but even if you can arrange just a few days, it all helps. We can usually help get you on and off tour. We're there to make it work for you. Even if you can only do a day or two, stop in for a day when the corps is in your area. All is appreciated!</p>
								<p>If you're a parent of a member, it's particularly important for you to spend time with the corps volunteering in some capacity. Hearing about your kid's standing ovation and being a part of it is the difference between sharing an important life-changing event with your kid or not. It's an amazing experience that can only be understood by living it. Chances to share something this important with your kid rarely come along, and you won't regret any of the inconvenience, sweat, sleep deprivation, or hard work. You will regret not finding a way to do it. </p>
								<p>Parents, volunteers, alumni, and supporters are all welcome to help. You will see every performance, all at no charge, too!<br></p>
                                
           <a name="cooktruck" id="cooktruck"></a><h3 class="section-title">Cook Truck</h3>
           <p><strong>Just like at home, everything important happens in the kitchen!</strong></p>
								 <p>Both corps serve four meals a day, prepared on-site from their specially designed kitchen trailers. The Colts have a full 48 foot converted semi-trailer and the Colt Cadets have a pull-behind trailer, affectionately called "The Chuck Wagon. Normally, there is a head cook who will plan a menu and help coach the rest of the team through food preparation, juice mixing, set up, and serving. Camps and spring training are the best time to learn the ropes without the challenges of travel. During tour, to travel comfortably for all, it is ideal to have no more than six individuals for the Colts cook truck and four for the Colt Cadets cook truck.</p>
              <p><strong>Check Out The Colts Virtual Cooktruck</strong></p>
								<p>Want to spend every day on tour with the Colts this year, at least from in front of your computer? Check out the <a href="http://coltscooktruck.blogspot.com/" target= "blank">Colts Virtual Cooktruck</a>. There will be something new from tour nearly every day as the Colts march their way through the summer. Daily menus. Schedules. Maps. Weather reports from the road. Tidbits and photographs.</p>
              
           <a name="drivers" id="drivers"></a><h3 class="section-title">Drivers</h3>
           <p><strong>We are always on the move!</strong></p>
           <p>The Colts convoy travels with a total of four busses, two semis, and two vans with trailers. The Colt Cadets convoy travels with a total of two busses, two vans with trailers, and a dooley pick-up with trailer. Driving is a great way to volunteer over the summer! Responsibilities include driving from stop to stop at night and driving from housing site to show site in the afternoon. Drivers typically spend the day sleeping and are awake at night. No CDL is required to drive the vans but it is required to drive the busses and pick-up with Colt Cadets. We look for one to two drivers for every week for Colts and four to six drivers for Colt Cadets.</p>
           
           <a name="threadteam" id="threadteam"></a><h3 class="section-title">Red Team Thread Team</h3>
           <p><strong>Looking for the perfect fit!</strong></p>
           <p>A necessary part of the Colts Youth Organization, the Red Team Thread Team handles all uniform fittings and alterations throughout the season to keep both corps looking good. They also are involved in many other projects that involve textiles: flags for the Colts and Colt Cadets, additions to props, and souvenir flags, to name a few. Experience with sewing and fitting is great but definitely not needed! Many jobs like pressing uniforms, seam ripping, and embellishing guard uniforms can be handled by people with no prior sewing experience whatsoever. The Red Team Thread Team is active during the audition and practice camp season with a wide variety of projects, the most important being initial uniform fittings and alterations. During tour, the Red Team Thread Team is usually on tour for about half the summer.</p>
