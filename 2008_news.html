            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Selected For 2009 Inaugural Parade</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>December 8, 2008</i></p>
                <p>The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps has received confirmation from the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee (AFIC) that they have been selected to represent the State of Iowa in the 2009 Inaugural Parade on Tuesday, January 20, in Washington, D.C.</p>
                <p>An <a href="documents/InauguralParadeOverview.pdf">overview of the Colts Inaugural Parade plans</a> was released at their annual awards banquet on Saturday, November 29. All Colts members and alumni are invited to participate in the parade.</p>
                <p>The Colts were one of several marching units from across the state that submitted a formal application to the AFIC in mid-November. Their selection brings great pride to an organization that has been providing outstanding musical performance and education since their founding in 1963.</p>
                 <p>From Iowa Governor Chet Culver's letter of endorsement, he writes, "In 2007, I was pleased to name the Colts as <i>Iowa's Ambassadors of Music</i> in recognition of their longstanding commitment to developing leadership in young people through challenging and highly demanding music programs."</p>
                 <p>Iowa Senator Pam Jochum called Greg Orwoll, Colts Executive Director, with congratulations and well wishes upon hearing the announcement. "Our inclusion in the Inaugural Parade is an incredible honor. We will be proud to represent the State of Iowa in this historic event," said Orwoll.</p>
                 <p>U.S. Congressman Bruce Braley, Iowa's First Congressional District Representative, wrote, "The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps would be a superb representative for our state. As one of the nation's premier drum and bugle corps, they exhibit an extraordinary degree of musicianship and perform at a spectacular level."</p>
                  <p>Letters of support were also submitted by U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley (IA), U.S. Rep. Leonard Boswell (IA), U.S. Rep. Steve King (IA), U.S. Rep. Tom Latham (IA), U.S. Rep. Don Manzullo (IL), former Governor Tom Vilsack (IA) and Iowa Speaker of the House Pat Murphy, along with the Iowa Dept. of Cultural Affairs, Dubuque Mayor Roy Buol, Dubuque Area Chamber of Commerce, Dubuque Community Schools Superintendent, Community Foundation of Dubuque, and Dubuque Symphony Orchestra.</p>
                  <p>Thank you to all of the individuals who wrote letters of support and assisted with the application process. Special thanks to Colts Board Member Peter Hansen for the inspiration, concept, research, and time invested in creating this opportunity on our behalf.</p>
                  <p>To find out more about the Colts, download this <a href="documents/ColtsInauguralFacts.pdf">Fact Sheet</a> that was included with the Colts inaugural parade application packet.</p>
                  <p>Further details regarding participation, planning, donor support, and logistics of our trip to Washington, D.C., will be released Wednesday, December 10, on the Colts website.</p>

	</div>
    		    <p><i>April 15, 2008</i></p>
                <p>The Senior High School band will premiere the commissioned work, "Echoes of Morning," on Wednesday, April 16 at 8 pm in Senior High School's Nora Gym. All are welcome to attend. We do not believe there is a charge for this event.</p>
                <p>"Echoes of Morning" was written by Patrick M. McCarty in memory of Bianca "B" Vocke. B was a student at Senior High School and guard member of the Colts. Patrick McCarty is the Assitant Director of Bands at Lawrence High School in Lawrence, KS and a Colts alumn ('99).</p>
                <p>In the notes about the music, McCarty states, "This piece strives to capture the wonderful traits of Binaca, while reminding us to cherish life and friendships. It strives to capture the essence of a beautiful morning sunrise and is loosely based on the Colts corps song."</p>
                <p>B passed away a few minutes after midnight on the morning of December 11, 2007. Her family was at her side, with the corps song, "Morning" playing in the background.</p>
                <p>Members, friends, fans, and anyone wishing to send a note to the family, is encouraged to do so. The words of friendship will be delivered to the family through Greg - please email Greg Orwoll at greg@colts.org or mail to the Colts office at Greg's attention.</p>
                <p>"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."</p>
                <p>Donations are being accepted for Bianca's family and Erin to help offset the tremendous medical expenses incurred. You can give to the funds by clicking the link at right under the Colts Store button.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
    		    <p><i>April 4, 2008</i></p>
                <p>We knew all along that there was the possibility that a construction project as big as this, spanning over four years, could potentially not come in exactly on schedule.  The DCI Championships were scheduled to be the first event in the new stadium.</p>
                <p>With this possibility in mind, we have had fall-back plans in development all along, and they are being implemented starting tonight.</p>
                <p>"The 10 year commitment we (DCI) has made to Indianapolis, and they have in turn made to us, is still a tremendous opportunity for us.  In my opinion, it is one the most significant decisions we have ever made in DCI.  Although this development is disappointing and frustrating, it does not tarnish the promise the future holds for us in Indianapolis and Lucas Oil Stadium." said Greg Orwoll, Colts Executive Director and DCI Board of Directors member.  "We have completed the move of the DCI offices and operations to Indy, and are up and running already."</p>
                <p>Following is the official news release from DCI, issued earlier this evening.  Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns on this, or anything else for that matter.</p>

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
(OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE FROM DRUM CORPS INTERNATIONAL)</p>
 
<p>2008 DRUM CORPS INTERNATIONAL WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS<br>
RELOCATED TO INDIANA UNIVERSITY</p>
 
<p>Memorial Stadium in Bloomington will play host to Marching Music's Major League" as it showcases the world's finest marching music ensembles</p>
 
<p>INDIANAPOLIS, IN - April 04, 2008 - Drum Corps International (DCI), the non-profit event producer and sanctioning body for the world's most elite and exclusive marching ensembles for student musicians, today announced the relocation of its 2008 World Championships to the massive 52,000-seat Memorial Stadium, on the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.</p>

<p>The event was originally scheduled to be held in the new Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, which will not be available in time for this year's premiere event in the world of marching music.</p>
 
<p>"Since the planning process began more than two years ago, we've realized that the possibility existed that the new stadium might not be ready in time to accommodate our 2008 World Championships," said Dan Acheson, Executive Director and CEO of Drum Corps International. "Unfortunately, as we found out this afternoon from a local news outlet, stadium construction officials have determined that the stadium will not be ready in time for our event this summer. We're a bit frustrated that we were 'scooped' on learning of this development, as we had no direct knowledge prior to the announcement that a change of venue was imminent. The notification occurring in this manner was not what any of those directly involved with our World Championships events had intended."</p>
 
<p>Contingency Plans in Place</p>

<p>As a part of the detailed planning process surrounding the annual Drum Corps International World Championships events, University and other officials from various community and governmental agencies have been working closely with DCI representatives to ensure a seamless process in the event of exactly such a possibility.</p>
 
<p>Tickets for the 2008 Drum Corps International World Championships at Bloomington will go on sale as soon as possible. Updated information will be released to corps directors and fans in the coming days regarding specific plans for the shift to the IU campus. Fans are urged to check DCI.org regularly for additional information.</p>
 
<p>Championship Preparations Underway</p>

<p>"Now that we know that Bloomington will be our home for the culmination of our 2008 Summer Tour, we're all looking forward to an exciting 2008 World Championships at an impressive venue in its own right," Acheson continued. "Clearly, there are many issues that we're moving quickly to address, and we're appreciative of our loyal fans who continue to be patient as we work to create a championship experience worthy of the exceptional performers of Drum Corps International's outstanding units. We're confident that the 2008 World Championships week activities will serve as merely the latest chapter in a tremendous legacy, and will contribute to the foundation of a long and deeply rewarding relationship with the fine people of the state of Indiana."</p>
