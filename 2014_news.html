            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Receive $12,500 Grant From Dubuque Racing Association</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>August 18, 2014</i></p>
      			<p>When the Dubuque Racing Association announced their grant awards to local nonprofit organizations just before summer, the Colts Youth Organization was pleased to learn it received $12,500 for the purchase of Colt Cadets percussion instruments. This was the 18th consecutive year that the Colts received a grant of $5,000 or more from the DRA.</p>
                <p>Those instruments were obviously put to good use as the Colt Cadets recently completed their season with a 10th place finish at the Drum Corps International Open Class Championships in Michigan City, Indiana.</p>
                <p>The Dubuque Racing Association (DRA) is the nonprofit license holder for the Mystique and Diamond Jo casinos. Grants have been offered to area nonprofit organizations through a competitive submission process since 1985.</p>
                <p>The two prior years, the DRA awarded the Colts the maximum amount offered with $40,000 in 2012 to purchase all-new uniforms for both the Colts and Colt Cadets, and $25,000 in 2013 for the completion of a new roof on the Colts Center at 11th & Central in downtown Dubuque.</p>
                <p>Since 1987, the Colts have received grants from the DRA totaling over $350,000 for new instruments, vehicles, uniforms, souvenir trailer, computers and other equipment, and building improvements.</p>
                <p>Thank you to the DRA for continuing to support the vision of the Colts Youth Organization and our mission to "use music & excellence to teach other about success in life."</p>

    <img src="/img/news/2014_season_end.jpg" alt="" class="alignleft imageborder">
      <p><i>August 18, 2014</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts and Colt Cadets concluded their 2014 seasons with performances at the Drum Corps International World Championships in Indianapolis, August 7-9. The Colt Cadets finished in 10th place at the DCI Open Class Finals in Michigan City on Tuesday, August 5 before joining the Colts in Indianapolis for the DCI World Class Prelims on Thursday, August 7.</p>
                <p>The Colts made an incredible charge at the end of the season to finish in 13th place at the DCI World Class Semifinals on Friday, August 8. The corps was just 0.1 of a point away from an opportunity to perform their show once again on Saturday night. One could argue the Colts were the hottest corps going down the stretch as the members dug in to deliver magical performances the last week of the season.</p>
                <p>Both corps wrapped up their tours and dismissed for the summer at Military Park in downtown Indianapolis on Saturday, August 9. For first-time members and parents, they realized the completion of the drum corps experience for this Summer of 2014. Much congratulations goes out to all members; the talented staffs, volunteers, and drivers of both corps; and all the parents who support this amazing opportunity for their kids.</p>
                <p>Colts Videographer Isaac Campbell is working on some end-of-season social media content. But while he's continuing that work, take a minute to go back and review his summer posts including the <i>Between 5Lines</i> series, <i>3PM Throwback</i> photos, and a variety of Tweets and Retweets from throughout the season:</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Medical Associates Foundation Grant Fuels Drum Corps Research</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>July 22, 2014</i></p>
      			<p>The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps was recently honored to receive a grant from the Medical Associates Clinic Foundation of Dubuque in the amount of $21,367.00 to fund a three-year medical research project to study the effects of the drum corps performance on its students.</p>
                <p>Steven Rock, MD and Melody Higgins, PhD will lead the project as volunteer co-coordinators of research for injuries and illness for the Drum Corps Medical Project (DCMP). Drs. Higgins and Rock are helping youth participants understand and reduce their risks for injury and illness while participating in the rigorous and physically demanding drum corps summer season.</p>
                <p>The team will utilize devices to collect and record data from Drum Corps International participants. These measurements and analyses will help the Colts and the DCMP facilitate safe and appropriate activities and performances for healthier youth within the drum corps activity.</p>
                <p>"(The grant from the Medical Associates Clinic Foundation of Dubuque) will allow us to gather data and work with Dr. Rock and Dr. Higgins to further develop ways to enhance and maintain the well-being of young people in this highly demanding physical activity," Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane wrote in the grant request.</p>
                <p>In addition to the benefits expected for students in the Colts, there are additional benefits that will serve Clarke University athletic training students integrally involved in clinical rotations that help youth in the Dubuque region. These encounters and rotations will provide Clarke students with real patients and real problems that require the students to collaborate with members of their clinical faculty as well as the health care communities throughout Clarke and the Dubuque region.</p>
                <p>"Medical Associates is excited to be able to support this important research that will both help protect our youth and provide additional learning opportunities for Clarke University's athletic training students," said John Tallent, Medical Associates Clinic Foundation Executive Director. "We are pleased that our Foundation can assist in this unique collaboration between Dr. Higgins, Dr. Rock, Clarke University, the Colts, and the Dubuque Community."</p>
                <p>The Colt summer tour includes approximately 40 competitions and performances in 12 states, covering over 11,000 miles, and will culminate at the Drum Corps International World Championships in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on August 7-9, 2014.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top"><i>No Boundaries</i> Documentary Showing At Mindframe</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>July 7, 2014</i></p>
      			<p>Mindframe Theaters is the place for the screening of <i>No Boundaries,</i> the documentary film produced about the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps. The film is showing Monday, July 7th, ONE NIGHT ONLY. Doors open at 6:30 PM. The screening will begin at 7:00 PM, and there will be a chance for Q&A afterwards.</p>
                <p>The showing is FREE and open to the public. Donations will be accepted with the money going directly to the Colts to assist with summer tour expenses.</p>
                <p>For those of you who don't recall the connection to Mindframe, Suzie Wright, the film's writer and producer, has a little story.</p>
                <p>"Our film's visionary executive producer, Molly first shared her idea to create this film with Grant Grudzina, who is one of the owners of Mindframe Theaters. He introduced Molly and I and so the film began.</p>
                <p>Mindframe is an independent movie house that has been very supportive of local filmmakers ever since they opened. In fact, the very first film I ever worked on, called <i>Ghost Player: Relive the Magic</i>, held its world premiere at Mindframe Theaters.</p>
                <p>Around the time we started planning that premiere, we also worked together to found the Great River Film Initiative, which is a network of local filmmakers. Members of that network have created dozens of short films, documentaries, and features since the group formed in 2009."</p>
                <p>Interested in more to this story? Stop out to Mindframe where Suzie and others will be on hand to answer questions about the film's conception and reality.</p>
                <p>Mindframe Theaters are located at 555 JFK Rd., Dubuque IA, behind the Kennedy Mall next to JoAnn's Fabrics. </p>

"The Dubuque City Council has consistently chosen support of the cultural arts as a high priority in our goals over the last eight years. Our investment and support has proven to make solid economic sense -- over $47 million dollars of sense for our local economy every year, and a critical element of what makes Dubuque a 'Masterpiece on the Mississippi'."</p>
                <p>Under the leadership of Mayor Buol, the arts and culture have enjoyed a tremendous resurgence as a result of his consistent advocacy of arts and cultural initiatives for the city. In 1995, when he first assumed office, the city provided zero funding for the arts and culture. But, under his leadership of mayor, the city has distributed $2.3 million to arts and cultural groups since 2005 for operating and project support, as well as for a public art project. Upon taking office, Mayor Buol also established an Arts & Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission.</p>
                <p><i><b>The Colts Youth Organization has been an annual recipient of an Arts & Cultural Affairs Grant since the program's inception. Last year, the organization received $40,000 for operating support.</b> The Colts Drum & Bugle Corps has been proud to represent the City of Dubuque in their travels throughout the United States for over 50 years.</i></p>
                <p>Mayor Buol facilitated the development of Dubuque's Comprehensive Downtown master plan that called for the formation of a cultural district and, in 2005, the city received the first Cultural District designation from the State of Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>
                <p>Through Mayor Buol's involvement in the America's River Project, the city has developed a nearly $400 million educational, entertainment, and historic riverfront project at the Port of Dubuque. Specifically, the Mississippi Riverwalk, the American Trust River's Edge Plaza, and the Alliant Energy Amphitheater were built to host multiple community arts and culture activities, including a now thriving roster of festivals. In 2006, Dubuque was named one of the first Iowa Great Places due to projects that sought to expand and continue the revitalization that has occurred along the citys riverfront within the last decade.</p>
                <p>"Mayor Buol is an elected official who understands the critical importance of arts, culture and creativity in creating vibrant communities and places," said Robert L. Lynch, President and CEO of Americans for the Arts. "Since 1995, when he began his public service as a city councilman, to 2005 when he was first elected mayor, he has made funding for the arts and culture, along with other arts friendly policy initiatives a priority of his administration."</p>
                <p>"Every year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors recognizes the efforts of those who believe as much as we do, that the arts are the heart of our society. Arts and culture help shape a city's quality of life, but mayors also understand the connection between the arts and business and the arts' impact on the local economy," said U.S. Conference of Mayors CEO and Executive Director Tom Cochran.</p>
                <p>Three other awards were presented at the breakfast event: Michigan Governor Rick Snyder; Akron, OH Mayor Don Plusquellic, and Actress Fran Drescher were also honored.</p>
