		</div>
	</div>
    		    <p><i>December 23, 2004</i></p>
                <p>The first audition weekend for the Colts was held December 17-19 in Dubuque.</p>
                <p>An early Christmas present of new Yamaha instruments was unwrapped Friday night by excited brass and percussion players and the work began. A record turn out for color guard and solid numbers and outstanding talent levels in brass and percussion led to a very successful weekend.</p>
                <p>In addition to individual auditions, all sections worked hard to produce an exceptional Sunday afternoon Dog and Pony show for parents, supporters and each other.  All who auditioned over the weekend had a chance to perform as a part of the 2005 Colts. Brass and percussion played the opening production together and the brass line performed a second piece from the show and worked on, but did not yet perform, a third.  60% of the summer music was being played by the brass line over the weekend.</p>
                <p>Nearly 100 parents attended a new parent information meeting Friday night and a number of important volunteer projects were completed over the weekend by willing parents and supporters.</p>
                <p>A few positions remain to be filled for the 2005 season in the low brass sections of the brass line. The next Colts rehearsal is January 14-16 in Dubuque. Information about location and further details will be posted at www.colts.org in advance of the rehearsal.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
        		<p><i>November 24, 2004</i></p>
        		<p>The Colts organization and Yamaha Corporation of America are pleased to announce the formation of a formal partnership for the 2005 season and beyond.</p>
                <p>The Colts will play Yamaha brass and percussion instruments exclusively, including new battery and melodic percussion instruments and all new brass.</p>
                <p>"The change-over to all Bb instruments was in our 5 year plan for this season, but we had not planned on percussion as well.  As we worked with Yamaha, however, it became apparent that our two organizations were very much aligned and a perfect fit together." said Greg Orwoll, Executive Director of the Colts.  "The decision to accept this offer from Yamaha was an easy one.  Yamaha brings to our organization everything we need in terms of top-quality instruments, a strong commitment to education and exemplary service and support."</p>
                <p>The partnership goes beyond just the open-class Colts corps to include the Colt Cadets and other Colts-sponsored local programs as well.</p>
                <p>"We're excited to get the chance to work with the entire Colts organization during the 2005 DCI season and beyond.  Their commitment to music and youth is clear with the high quality of all their program offerings.  From the Division I Drum Corps down to the younger student programs like the Dubuque Area Summer Band, it's clear that the entire Colts organization is a valuable partner with Yamaha in Music Education," said Kurt Witt, Yamaha's Marketing Manager for Wind Instruments.</p>
                <p>Witt continued, "There are a number of other corps that had expressed interest in playing Yamaha, but to be honest, we were really looking for quality rather than quantity.  And with the addition of the Colts I feel like we've really got quality organizations in DCI playing Yamaha products."</p>
                <p>Orwoll expects to have the complete line of new Yamaha brass instruments, except tubas, in hand for the Colts audition weekend December 17-19 in Dubuque.  The battery and most of the melodic instruments will be delivered for the first camp as well.  More information about Colts rehearsals can be found at www.colts.org.</p>
                <p>The Colts join the Cavaliers, the Cadets, Crossmen and Bluecoats in playing Yamaha instruments exclusively in Drum Corps International.</p>
