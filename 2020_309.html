			    <p>Aidan Connolly lands back at the Colts for his third time. He marched in the Colts baritone section in 2015. After taking two years off to pursue his journalism degree, he returned to the Colts brass line to age out in 2018. Aidan had not been a stranger following his age out as he volunteered regularly in a variety of capacities during preseason camps and on tour during the summer. He joined the Colts Youth Organization full time as Director of Media & Events in November 2019.</p>	
                <p>"I was working in the data services sector when I saw the announcement about the Colts opening," said Aidan. "I knew how much I enjoyed my drum corps experience and always felt a calling to give back in some way. I’m excited to see how my journalism and data analytics skills will add to the already productive staff at the Colts."</p>
                <p>Aidan received a Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of Nebraska – Lincoln. He minored in informatics, mathematics, music, and music technology. He is also fluent in using the suite of Adobe Creative Cloud products which adds to his tool box in managing the Colts website, creating content for all social media channels, assisting with recruiting efforts, and working on the Colts-hosted DCI summer tour events.</p>
                <p>"We were excited to bring Aidan onto our team," Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane said. "He brings a unique set of skills that will help us refine our brand and grow our efforts in many areas including recruiting, merchandise and ticket sales, fundraising, alumni relations, and analytics involving all of our programs, products and constituencies."</p>
                <p>"I am thrilled to have Aidan with the Red Team," Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane said. "Aside from his technical strengths, he’s thorough, approachable, and an incredible role model for our members. He will add great value to the drum corps, our events, and the Colts office team!"</p>
                <p>The Colts Youth Organization serves young people who desire high levels of challenge, achievement and success, and their programs carry an expectation that participants are committed to hard work and dedication. Their flagship program — Colts Drum & Bugle Corps — has been a continuous thread in Dubuque’s artistic and educational fabric since 1963, providing access to the drum and bugle corps activity for thousands of young people, and enriching the community for all those who have experienced a performance.</p>
