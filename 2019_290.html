                <p><i>September 4, 2019</i></p>
                <p>The Colts are excited to welcome Dr. Matthew Jordan in the role of music advisor as a part of the 2020 design team. In his role, Matt will work closely with Program Coordinator Don Click and the entire music design team on music effects, pacing, and overall design of the musical package. Matt has been active in the pageantry arts as a performer, designer, educator, and adjudicator with scholastic and independent groups around the world, most recently as one of the front ensemble designers for Music City Mystique, a position he has held since 2014. Matt's experience with McM began as a marching member from 2000 to 2005, and he has been on staff in various capacities since aging out. Matt also currently serves as the music coordinator and sound designer for the Bluecoats Drum & Bugle Corps. Outside of the marching arts, Matt serves as the visiting assistant professor of percussion at Jacksonville State University, where he coordinates all concert percussion activities for the university's school of music. Matt has completed a Doctor of Music degree from Florida State University, a Masters of Music degree from the University of North Texas, and Bachelor of Music degree from Middle Tennessee State University. <a href="/people-staff-colts" target="_blank">Read Matt's full bio here.</a></p>
                <p>“I’m excited to be joining this wonderful team of designers, colleagues, and friends," said Matt. "I have worked with Don, Josh, Meagan, Sean, and Mark many times over the years in various capacities, and I’m looking forward to seeing what creative things this Colts design team can bring to the table!”</p>
                <p>"Matt's influence on the drum corps activity has shaped many programs throughout the years," said Program Coordinator Don Click. "We are ecstatic that he will be advising the Colts on our music journey for the 2020 season."
                <p>"I'm beyond excited to have Matt with us as music advisor," said Colts Director Vicki MacFarlane. "With an already strong design team, Matt's skill set, passion, and synergy will add even further value to an incredible program, and sets the stage to provide the members with an unforgettable performing experience. I have no doubt we will have an even stronger production with Matt's engagement."</p>
