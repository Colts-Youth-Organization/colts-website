                <p><i>March 26, 2020</i></p>
                <p>Drum Corps International  <a href="https://www.dci.org/news/member-corps-vote-to-cancel-2020-dci-tour">announced today</a>  a decision made by their Voting Membership to cancel the 2020 summer tour, which was scheduled to kick off on Thursday, June 18, in Detroit, Michigan.</p>

<p>The Colts joined their competitive brethren in voting for cancellation of the tour. The health and safety of our members, staff and volunteers is at the top of everyone’s priority list, and the spread of COVID-19 appears as if it will impact many parts of the country into the summer months. </p>

<p>At the same time, the Voting Membership adopted an exception to the DCI rules regarding age of eligibility. The exception states, “Any member whose last year of eligibility was the 2020 season shall be eligible to compete in the 2021 season.”</p>

<p>For the Colts, we are planning to offer alternative approaches to engage our students in a virtual drum corps experience throughout the summer with lessons on music, movement, and physical fitness routines that will put us in great shape to, literally, hit the ground running as preparations begin for the 2021 season.</p>

<p>“While I’m saddened by the inevitable disruption to our activity, I know my disappointment pales in comparison to that of our students and staff who have been working so hard but now have to wait to see their work come to fruition,” said Colts Board President Jim Johnson. “The Colts staff and our Board of Directors remain mission-focused and will continue our practices of doing what’s right and putting people first.”</p>

<p>Another disappointing piece of the COVID-19 puzzle is not having the opportunity to welcome thousands of drum corps fans to our four “home” shows in Dubuque, Ankeny, Olathe and Cedar Rapids. Those who purchased tickets to any of our shows, or who purchased tickets to the DCI World Championships via the Colts website, will be contacted in the next week or so regarding refunds.</p>

<p>Additional details specific to the members of each corps will be coming soon from their respective corps directors — Vicki (Colts) and Rich (Colt Cadets).</p>

<p>Ongoing plans for the summer include an announcement of the Colts Hall of Fame Class of 2020. With the time you are spending at home social distancing, please consider all the wonderful staff members, volunteers or fellow members you marched with and submit a nomination before the May 15 deadline. Information about the Colts Hall of Fame and a link to nominations details are  <a href="/2020_317">available on our website</a> . The Class of 2020 will be announced this summer, and formally introduced at the 2021 Music On The March in Dubuque.</p>

<p>“I believe there is an even greater future for the Colts on the other side of this,” said Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane. “Navigating the days and months ahead is certainly going to present significant challenges, but I have faith that our fans, alumni, supporters, members, and the Dubuque community will provide the strength needed to continue this character-building, life-changing experience for decades to come.”</p>
