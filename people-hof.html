For the Colts, he would teach, drive, and help with any job that needed to be done. He was a great ear for members to talk to on a daily basis. He was a great listener and counselor for staff and members. Ron was the calm, level-headed-balance guy that could bring peace to any emotional situation on tour.</p><p>Dedicated, committed, helpful and, most importantly, caring.</p><p>For these traits and many others too numerous to mention here, Ron Coleman has absolutely earned the honor of being in the Colts Hall of Fame.</p>"

He had always been a &ldquo;doer&rdquo; and he jumped in to volunteer any way he could.</p><p>Following Chris&rsquo; second season in the baritone section, he arrived for fall rehearsals — again with his dad. With an abundance of parents in the kitchen, Peter decided to attend a Saturday meeting of the Board of Directors just to see what was going on. He was welcomed in and was formally elected to the Board in 2007.</p><p>Peter was always a Board member to speak his mind, challenge convention, and try to push to the organization to greater achievement. While the Colts would eventually charter buses (as they do today), Peter was a long-time proponent of &ldquo;getting out of the bus business.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter was then splitting time between the family’s home in Lawrence, Kansas, and his wife’s apartment in Washington, D.C., where Gail had taken a job with the Centers for Disease Control.</p><p>Following the historic election of the first black President of the United States, Peter conceived and organized the Colts Presidential Inaugural Parade participation in January 2009. The parade was not only an amazing opportunity for alumni to &ldquo;put on the Reds&rdquo; one more time, it also became a significant fundraiser for the organization.</p><p>When the Colts looked to expand their hosted events in 2010, Peter organized the first Colts-sponsored DCI show in the Kansas City metro area. Even though his residence has now permanently shifted from Lawrence, Kansas, to Washington, D.C., he continues to coordinate the show to this day — although he is aggressively seeking a replacement.</p><p>Peter became President of the Board in 2017, serving just two years, because his goal was to begin a regular succession of Board leadership — two years V.P., two years as President, and two years Past President.</p><p>As President, he became very involved in fundraising with special attention to large capital campaign projects. He helped drive several fundraising efforts including last year’s successful &ldquo;Carry The Load&rdquo; Campaign to replace both of the Colts semitrailers.</p><p>According to Colts Executive Director Jeff MacFarlane, &ldquo;Actually, I just wanted to build the equipment trailer and leave the kitchen trailer for the following year. But Peter pushed us to fundraise for both at the same time and it worked.&rdquo;</p><p>Peter remains engaged in fundraising and cultivating donors in his time as Past President. In addition to building the Colts donor base, Peter and his wife, Gail, have themselves been generous supporters throughout the years. And now that they are in D.C., they like to take a day and make smoothies for the entire drum corps on a day that the Colts are heading up the East Coast.</p>"

Jim’s graduation, full-time employment, and a move to Indiana brought his employment to an end mid-season 1992, but in 1996, Jim was hired to be the Director of the Colt Cadets. He served in that role in 1996 and 1997, simultaneously serving as the de facto brass caption head, tour manager, and 1997 drill writer.</p><p>In 1997, Jim experienced another college graduation, cross-country move, and a return to full-time employment, ending his close involvement with the Colt Cadets. He kept hanging around, though, and by that time he had pulled his partner Barry Magee into the activity as a frequent volunteer. Eventually, Barry became one of the recurring head cooks for the Colts, and when another job transition freed up Jim’s summers in 2001, Jim began his career as a cooktruck volunteer. Jim and Barry were regulars on the cooktruck until 2009, and Jim returned to occasional stints in that role a few years later.</p><p>Jim joined the Board of Directors in 2015 and served as a member for three years before being elected President at the end of 2018.</p><p>Beyond the Colts, Jim was involved with the Drums On The Ohio competition in Evansville, IN between 1993 and 2001, serving as co-chair in 2000 and show chairman in 2001. He volunteered annually for Drum Corps International from 2008-2019, serving as local chair and site liaison for the Corps Experience Committee in 2008-2009.</p><p>Jim currently lives in Bloomington, IN with his husband Barry and two dogs, and he works at Indiana University as the Associate Director of the Student Involvement and Leadership Center.

And that rubbed off on everyone around him.</p><p>Doug carried a little more weight than many, but he still marked time higher (remember, members used to mark time by bringing your foot to your knee), he played with more intensity, and he was almost always the first one back to reset for the next rep. And his effort paid off.</p><p>Scanning through an old Drum Corps Planet forum about the best soloists that were not sopranos (trumpets), Doug&rsquo;s name appears regularly — along with 2018 Colts HOF inductee David Lang. Doug was the Colts resident baritone soloist in mid- to late-'70s, and after seven dedicated years here, he took his talents to the West Coast to spend one season with the Concord Blue Devils. And, of course, he was featured there in 1980 as half of the &ldquo;Dindi&rdquo; duet.</p><p>But he wasn’t done. Doug, now known as &ldquo;Pooh Bear,&rdquo; would go on to march in many all-age groups including the Kilties, Royal-Aires, and Renegades. He marched in the Anaheim Kingsmen Alumni Corps at the 2007 DCI World Championships in the Rose Bowl.</p><p>Doug married his Colts sweetheart, Cindy Steichen, and together they brought another amazing drum corps performer into the world. Kayla began in the Colt Cadets color guard in 2002 and finished her drum corps career a dozen years later, just months after Dad was taken by cancer. He was very proud of his daughter.</p><p>For these reasons, and many others that memory will later confirm, Doug &ldquo;Moonwhale&rdquo; Kenyon takes his rightful place in the 2020 Colts Hall of Fame. Doug would have just turned 60 in July of this year. His time has come to receive the Colts highest honor. R.I.P. Moony!</p>"

Kent was the band director at Maquoketa High School.</p><p>Kent stopped by for a spring rehearsal, joined the brass staff that summer, and beginning in 2004, served as brass caption head for the Colt Cadets for the next 11 seasons.</p><p>Kent did incredible work for many years with the Colt Cadets brass ensemble, annually taking young — often beginning — brass students and, with care and expert advice, turning them into brass players with a great future and outlook. He belongs in the Colts Hall of Fame because of his positive impact and highly effective inﬂuence on generations of Colts brass players.</p><p>Another wonderful Colts brass teacher, Tom Lizotte, had this to say about Kent: “His love for the Colt Cadets and quality brass playing is palpable. His practice of being a lifelong learner has been inspirational to me. For a number of years we taught the Colt Cadets together, he as brass caption head, I as a program and performance consultant. He was never threatened having another voice enter the picture and was very ﬂexible with his plan. Often I would ﬁnish a visit and Kent would immediately get in touch with a boatload of good questions. When we talked about an approach to performance issues, he swung into action. When next I visited, those issues had obviously been addressed —  and solved.”</p><p>In 2012, Tom’s colleague from Maine, Terry White, would become the Colt Cadets brass arranger. Terry shared his thoughts on Kent’s nomination, “As I got to know Kent, and both of us being of the same age, I felt very comfortable with Kent personally and admired his approach working with younger students. He was very caring and spot-on with his teaching concepts. It was very apparent that the kids adored him. The quality of sound he was able to get them to produce was far more mature than other students their age. Over the next few years, we shared many of our teaching experiences and I found that we had more in common than one would imagine. I was able to continue our relationship by writing some arrangements for Kent’s high school band.</p><p>”Aside from his incredible work as an educator, Kent would also use his CDL skills to drive the Colt Cadets equipment trailer when the group needed a driver. Truly one of the most giving and humble people to ever teach our students, it is with great pride that we induct Kent Crawford into the Colts Hall of Fame.</p>"

Emily was going to be more than just a great member.” In her six years in the Colts organization, Emily Neuendorf quickly moved from being a rookie to being a valued member of the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps.

Her leadership on the podium took the corps to a 13th place ﬁnish in 1997, and 12th place ﬁnishes at DCI ﬁnals in 1998 and 1999.

She felt it as a member of the soprano line and she felt it as the drum major. It was obvious from the memorable DCI video of her on the podium at the completion of the Colts performance in 1999 that she was feeling it, and her leadership allowed the corps to feel it as well. Emily set the standard for service, dedication and leadership that continued with a recent term on the Colts board of directors.</p><p>As one of her peers wrote in her nomination, Emily was always “all in” when it came to the Colts.

Larry could easily slip into the role of section leader, and he had a relaxed style of teaching and directing sectional rehearsals. One of his contemporaries noted that with Larry there, “sectional rehearsals turned into productive learning and rehearsal sessions. We actually fixed stuff, and nobody felt singled out or made an example. When it was time to work, he worked hard. He rarely criticized the less disciplined among us; he led by example. It was effective!”</p><p>Larry was a talented musician who found a home in ‘Iowa’s Corps’ and became a leader with the Colts.

            'bio': "<p>The Colts winter guard came out of nowhere in the spring of 1976 to capture the prestigious Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship. This was a major title in the days the preceded Winter Guard International (WGI). They went on to win the 1976 V.F.W. Color Guard National Championship, in a season that culminated with a Bronze Medal at the DCI Color Guard Championships in Philadelphia. Tonight we honor three people who were at the heart of this run to glory: Steve Suslik, Wally Meissner and Jane (MacFarlane) Kohl.</p><p>Steve Suslik was invited to join the Colts staff in the fall of 1975 when the corps decided to enter the world of winter guard. Steve had marched and taught guard for The Cavaliers, and was initially hesitant to sign until he realized the guard had the potential to be very competitive. He came to Dubuque to watch a rehearsal and believed the talent level in the room could be a championship contender. He signed on and started coming to Dubuque for weekend guard rehearsals from his home in the Chicago area.</p><p>The Colts guard traveled to performances each weekend in the Chicago suburbs as there was no winter guard circuit in Iowa. They would perform on Saturday, spend the night in a school or hotel, and then perform again on Sunday before returning home. Under Steve’s leadership, their precision and determination led them to become a surprise contender for the 1976 Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship. By season’s end, they accomplished their goal and won the title. Following his work with the Colts, Steve went on to become a judge and worked many years in the pageantry arts.</p><p>Wally Meissner joined Steve Suslik on their trips from Chicago to work with the Colts color guard. Steve may have been more recognized as the innovator of the group, but Wally was a master technician — cleaning each of the guard elements to absolute perfection. Wally had also marched with The Cavaliers and certainly shared in creating and orchestrating a winter guard program that took the Midwest Color Guard Circuit by storm.</p><p>The two had written a wonderful color guard show that included many innovative elements. Their signature move — at a time when perfection was more highly regarded than attempt — created a wagon wheel moving across the floor with the flags circling the Color Guard Sergeant. The flawless execution of the circle, and the interval between performers as they rotated, is what made the move stand out among other groups.</p><p>Wally was a huge factor in bringing Steve’s vision to reality, at a time when perfection was the hallmark of a champion.</p><p>Jane MacFarlane served as “boots on the ground” in Dubuque when Steve and Wally were in Chicago during the week — they could only make it to Dubuque on weekends. Jane had begun marching in the Colts color guard at age 15. She marched five years from 1969 to 1973, eventually becoming Color Guard Sergeant. In 1973 Jane married her high school sweetheart Jim Kohl (a member of the percussion section). Unfortunately this meant that she could no longer be a corps member as in 1973 you were not allowed to be in the corps if you were married.</p><p>While marriage ended Jane’s participation as a member, she joined the teaching staff, and when the Colts winter guard program was being developed, she spearheaded a group of former members, including Betty Walbrun and Ellen Fangman, to lead Monday through Friday rehearsals. She became known for high expectations and set the bar for perfection – a bar that had a major impact on the 21 girls from Dubuque delivering near-flawless performances week after week.</p><p>Together Steve, Wally and Jane led the way to the Colts’ one and only national championship. Their pursuit of perfection led an unknown group of guard girls from Iowa to one of the most cherished titles in the winter guard world. It is with great pride that we welcome them into the Colts Hall of Fame.</p>"

Brenda did a stint as the President of the Colts Booster Club, Jim helped sell ads for the Music On The March program, and both were active volunteers every year, either selling brats or collecting tickets at the home show.</p><p>By 1982 an influx of members from outside of Dubuque caused a housing crunch. From 1982 through 1990, Jim and Brenda not only housed their own three kids, but at times had 10 additional members living with them when the corps was not on tour. However, their most significant contribution to the Colts was the work they did to start the Colts food program.</p><p>Up until that point, the corps primarily toured in the Midwest and there was no consistently organized food program – members often went in search of fast food when it was time to eat. Developing a consistent food program allowed the corps to travel further and to travel much more efficiently.</p><p>Jim and Brenda took the plunge and agreed to be the first full time cooks for the Colts during the summer of 1981. Jim brought some experience, having cooked at Ring’s, Clarke College and other establishments in town. But that was nothing like cooking on tour! With a gutted-out Winnebago (no AC or cruise control), shelves holding roasters and kitchen supplies, and a floor dotted with coolers, they joined the corps on its first-ever extended tour: Milwaukee to Geneseo, then south into Louisiana, Houston, Austin, Dallas, Tulsa, and Kansas City, before wrapping matters up in the Chicago area for July 4th. This was followed by a second tour in late July and early August.</p><p>Who drove the Winnebago? Jim did with Brenda as his co-pilot. Who did the daily shopping? Jim and Brenda. Who cooked and served the meals each day? Jim and Brenda. Who washed the dishes? Jim and Brenda. Access to water was occasionally available by hose; however, more often, water had to be hauled from a school shower to the outside makeshift kitchen.</p><p>Brenda passed away in 1991 and Jim in October 2017. Jim was active with the Colts right up until his last months — he was even cooking burgers for the Colt Cadets after the 2017 home show. Jim and Brenda were the pioneers in getting the Colts food program started, and running smoothly — a food program that is now recognized as one of the best in the activity. For this significant contribution to the corps, they are extremely deserving of being recognized as inductees into the Colts Hall of Fame.</p>"

He was drum major of the Colts in 1993 when the corps broke into the fabled Drum Corps International Top 12 — a tough feat for a corps so comparatively underfunded. It was his first year as drum major. Chris was drum major in the next three years of Colts Top 12 achievement — 1994, 1995, and 1996. This continuity of leadership and spirit was a gift to an activity in which drum majors often turn over each new season. Mature beyond his years, Chris‘ relationships were strong with fellow members as well as staff and Colts administration.

            'bio': "<p>Fifty years ago this summer, Sonia Hickson had a vision to expand the existing corps in Dubuque by offering younger kids (generally eleven years and up) to join the drum corps without the time commitment of the “older” corps. The birth of the Legionaires “B” corps was formed and Sonia became its first director.</p><p>Sonia believed that no individual should be turned away regardless if they had any experience so long as they had a desire to learn how to march, play a bugle, beat a drum, or twirl a flag. And once the kids were dressed in their uniforms and carrying their instruments off the bus, we’re not sure who was more excited — Sonia or the new members about to march in their very first parade.</p><p>Sonia’s enthusiasm, passion and love for the Colts did not stop after her years as director of the “B” corps and Colt .45 Cadets. As time went on, Sonia turned her talent to raising money for the organization. In those days, there was no internet or social network to solicit funds or spread news about the Colts — but there was the “Sonia Network.” She had an infectious charisma to meet and deal with all of Dubuque from the very youngest Colts member to the most distinguished business VIPs in the city. And as a lifetime resident and independent business owner, she had innumerable contacts and followers that she called upon whenever funds were needed by the Colts.</p><p>Until her passing in December 2014, Sonia was a faithful supporter and consummate advocate and fundraiser for the Colts organization. The Colts values were also Sonia’s values and she was a true ambassador for the Colts Drum & Bugle Corps. And she is now a member of the Colts Hall of Fame.</p>"

But by this time, he already had a decade of accomplishments with the group in other capacities.</p><p>Jim wrote the very first marching drill for the Legionnaires field show when they began competition in the late 1960s. He also taught marching during that same time, and for several years to come. But marching was not the extent of his teaching. Jim was an English teacher at Wahlert High School for nearly four decards. The Colts had a great bond with Wahlert High School with many of its members from the late 1960s and early 1970s attending the school. The passion Jim had for the Colts certainly led many of these students to find out what drum corps was all about.</p><p>Jim also had a passion for the emerging art of winter guard. He was instrumental in the formation of the Colt .45 Color Guard that was not only one of the Midwest’s finest units, but a national power house as well. The guard would go on to win many state competitions, the Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship, and finally the 1976 V.F.W. National Championship. That same year the Colts Color Guard finished 3rd at the Drum Corps International Color Guard Championships in Philadelphia.</p><p>Jim became a respected adjudicator for Drum Corps International primarily in the areas of marching performance and general effect. He judged into the late 1980s and went on to consult for many high school marching bands.</p><p>On this 40th anniversary of his announcement as the first executive director of the Colts, it is only fitting and truly deserving that Jim Killoran be inducted into the Colts Hall of Fame.</p>"

Tom has contributed money to the Colts over the years because he believes in the mission and the positive effect the Colts have on the community. Tom was willing to take a chance on the Colts because of those beliefs. He approved the loan, and set the organization on a new path.</p><p>In 2008, Tom became a member of the board of directors. As a board member, he helped the organization create awareness with people in the business and financial communities. His reputation in the local community and his passion for the Colts and the mission convinced these potential donors that the organization was a “good investment.” He directly or indirectly raised large scale donations that allowed the corps to not only just survive — but to thrive. His personal commitment gave those looking on the confidence that the organization was in good hands.</p><p>Few people know of Tom’s work behind the scenes. He’s quiet and unassuming.

He did not just teach students how to play an instrument. He engaged his students in a way that compelled them to seek higher purpose as a performer. Dean taught from his heart and in doing so, found a way to touch each student's soul. He found ways to motivate and encourage people to be the best they could possibly be, even at times when that seemed impossible.

The corps was going through a transition period with a lot of new members, and a massive influx of members from outside of Dubuque.

His optimism, enthusiasm and commitment to the Colts were influential on many corps members lives.

He saw how much the Colts were a positive influence on the lives of his children, so he was there every step of the way with them and for the corps. For example, the Colts used to perform in exhaustingly long and sometimes very hot Midwest parades in the summer heat. When we did, Joe was there beside them looking for members who might be affected by the heat, and ready to assist in providing water, or other assistance as needed. At times when it was necessary to make a trip to a local medical facility to help members who were ill or in need of help, Joe was always there to lend a hand.  </p><p>Joe never looked for, nor wanted, acknowledgement of his service.
