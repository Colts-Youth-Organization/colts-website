            <p>
              Originally founded as the "Junior Dukes" in 1963 by American Legion Post #6 in Dubuque as a junior corps for students in the tri-state area, the
              Colts have grown to become one of the longest lived and most consistently successful drum corps in the activity. In 1967, the organization began a
              Cadet corps for younger students in the area. Going through many name and identity changes throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the organization
              finally landed on the name "Colts" for the older corps and "Colt Cadets" for the younger corps in 1976. That same year, the Colts sponsored a
              winter guard that quickly earned national acclaim. The guard captured the prestigious Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship, and later that
              year won the V.F.W. National Color Guard Championship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, the organization has grown considerably, and annually impacts more than 500 students through the two drum corps, summer band, and
              steel drum ensembles, as well as thousands of fans who see the groups perform every season. The Colts have experienced significant competitive
              success, placing in the Top 12 at the Drum Corps International World Championships eight times since 1993 and in the Top 25 every year since 1982.
              The Colts Cadets have also had competitive success, placing in the Top 12 at the Drum Corps International Open Class Championships seven times
              since 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Colts mission, "We use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life," is the driving force behind all the programs offered
              and pushes the organization to constantly provide the best student experience in the activity.

                <h3>1963 &amp; 1964</h3>
                <p><strong>Drum Major: Barry Buelow</strong></p>
                <p>
                  In the spring of 1963, after hosting a drum corps show for several years, the American Legion Post in Dubuque decided to start it's own junior
                  corps. A committee was appointed to form a junior corps. An ad in the paper asked for boys interested to come to a meeting at the American
                  Legion Hall. The boys were given old bugles and drums from the senior corps. The adult corps was known as the "Dukes of Dubuque" so the corps
                  adopted the name "The Junior Dukes".
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first uniform of the Junior Dukes consisted of black pants and shoes and a white shirt- all furnished by the corps members. Members were
                  furnished with a black and white overseas cap with a red tassel.
                </p>
                <p>The name "Junior Dukes" appeared on the hat. They also wore a bolo tie with the Dubuque Packing Company "Fleur de lis" on it.</p>
                <p>
                  The Junior Dukes consisted of 38 boys, of which there were 24 horns, 10 drums, 2 flags and 2 guards for the American Flag. Anyone who couldn't
                  play an instrument was a guard on the American Flag, also because of limited equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first two years the corps was a parade unit. Dick Davis taught horns, drums and marching. In 1964, Clarence Hagge started to teach the
                  Junior Dukes horns and marching.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Dukes of Dubuque folded in 1964 and the senior group lost interest. At that time Clarence Hagge, Dick Davis and Bob Buelow took over the
                  corps. With the folding of the senior corps the junior corps considered a name change. Thus it was that the "Legionnaires" took the field in
                  1965.

                <p>This was the first year the corps marched under the name "Legionnaires."</p>
                <p>
                  It is interesting to note that some show programs called the corps The Dubuquers or spelled the name Legion Aires or Legionaires or
                  Legionnaires.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only 15 of the 48 boys who marched in 1964 returned. The corps attempted to recruit 13 to 15 year olds instead of 16 year olds because they
                  felt they could keep them involved longer. The corps numbered 42 this year.
                </p>
                <p>The corps uniform consisted of black long sleeve shirts, a white scarf, black pants and black shoes.</p>
                <p>
                  This was the only year the corps marched under the name Legionnaires in which only boys participated. Girls were added to the membership in
                  the fall of 1965.

                  The corps made several parade appearances in Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin as members of The Iowa American Legion Sponsored Uniformed Group
                  (IALSUG), Badgerland Drum and Bugle Corps Association, Mid-American Drum and Bugle Corps Circuit and the Midwest Color Guard Circuit.

                  This year the corps had 80 members with an average age of 16. The Cadets were formed in the fall of 1967 as a feeder corps for the "A" corps.
                  At that time they were called the "A" corps and the "B" corps. Sonia Hickson was the first director of the Cadets, assisted by members of the
                  "A" corps.

                      1968 was the first full year of competition. The corps traveled over 4000 miles this year and were honored with a day set aside as
                      recognition day to show Dubuque that the corps was a special benefit to the city by the example it set.

                      Championship. The City of Dubuque proclaimed the Legionnaires the "Junior Ambassadors of Goodwill" for the city of Dubuque and were
                      presented with the official Dubuque city flag.

                  The name change to the Colt .45 became official on November 14, 1968. The change was due primarily to the corps desiring to perform/compete in
                  a greater variety of shows other than Legion sponsored events.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was the first year the Colt .45 adopted its all western uniforms and music. The uniforms consisted of black and white fringed shirts,
                  black or white pants and black, pleated skirts with white inlays for the color guard. Red ties and pettipants and cowboy boots and hats
                  completed the uniforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The corps competed in Class A competition for the first time and won almost every contest in which they entered. The corps participated in 18
                  events with stops in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan. The longest trip was to Munsing and Marquette, MI on Lake Superior.
                </p>
                <p>The corps rounded out their season by winning the Mid-American Circuit Championship and the Iowa VFW Junior Championship.</p>
                <p>The purchase of the corps first truck was the first "big" investment.</p>
                <p>The Cadets had 86 members and had their first field drill.</p>

                  The corps dropped the .45 from its name citing the limited music available in the western theme and the association with the gun and beer.

                  The Colts consisted of 105 members, although the number kept fluctuating. 23 members quit during the course of the summer. The corps had 2
                  uniforms this year, parade and competition. The parade uniform consisted of the guards wearing red shirts and black skirts with white pleats.
                  The rest of the corps wore pants and white shirts with red gingham western yokes. The competition uniforms were the old "western style" the
                  corps had revitalized.

                  The 1976 Color Guard started their competing season with 21 people. They finished 1st in 6 contests and captured the Championship Title at the
                  Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship in Elmhurst, IL. The VFW National Color Guard Championship in New York City was their next
                  competition. The Colts Competition Guard was declared the 1976 VFW National Color Guard Champions and scored the highest number of points in
                  the history of the VFW National Guard Championships. The entire Colts Color Guard was named the 1976 VFW National Color Guard Parade
                  Champions. A few days later at the DCI Color Guard Championship the guard took 3rd place.

                  The 1977 corps was the largest in history to date with 120 members, of which only 9 were from outside of the Dubuque area. The Cadets fielded
                  61 members.

                <p>
                  New uniforms were purchased. They consisted of an orange riverboat gambler style formal jacket with a white ruffled shirt and black tie with
                  black pants worm by the horns and drums. The color guard had gold jackets and black skirts and all sections wore a round black gambler hat.
                  The Competition Guard had two units. At the Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship the Color Guard took second while the Colts "Too" took
                  21st. At the Iowa American Legion State Color Guard Championships the Colts won 1st place and Colts "Too" second place. At the American Legion
                  Color Guard Championship in Denver the Colts finished 2nd while the Colts "Too" finished 4th. The Colts won the VFW National Color Guard

                  1978 marked the first year of the World Guard International Competition and the Colts guard finished 4th. The guard also finished 3rd at the
                  Midwest Color Guard Finals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The corps purchased new bugles in December of 1977. The sopranos and baritones were the new two valve variety and the mellophones, french
                  horns and contras were the old single piston. The total purchase cost $21,354 for 63 horns. The instruments had a brass lacquer finish. Only
                  two other corps used this type of horn. The theory behind the brass horn was that it created a darker tone when played. The Colts season found
                  the corps trying to recover from the largest turnover ever recorded in corps history. The corps barely missed Associate Membership again by
                  placing 27th at the DCI Championships in Denver, CO.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the goal of becoming an Associate Member in DCI was not met, the season proved to be very interesting for all of the marching
                  members. Because of the huge turnover in membership the corps needed a couple months to find itself and the reasons why it was putting in 12
                  to 15 hour days. The reason became clear when the corps left on tour. A recent corps tradition, that of a family atmosphere, started to
                  develop and the days of work and sacrifice became worthwhile as the realization set in. Not only was the work paying off in self satisfaction,
                  but there also developed the notion of trying just because you knew the person next to you was putting out 100%.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was this feeling of being a family that let every member take satisfaction in some of the accomplishments that were awarded to individual
                  members. Among these accomplishments include: Bob Vasquez being named 3rd runner-up for Best Drum Major of the Year by Drum Corps World and
                  Jolene Miller-O'Toole was named Color Guard Captain of the Year by Drum Corps World.

                  The year started with a new uniform look for the drum line. Off came the orange jackets to be replaced by bright yellow vests and black garter
                  belts. The guard utilized the orange jackets with black leotards and tights. The rifle line also presented a new look by donning red vests
                  during certain parts of the show. The corps also had 27 new flags.

                <p>
                  1979 proved to be another trying year for the Colts, a fact compounded by yet another large turnover in membership. Also, due to financial
                  problems the corps didn't tour extensively but did travel to the DCI Championships in Birmingham, AL and placed 35th. The guard was especially
                  hard hit by membership turnover with no less than 27 new members. Even with this turnover they placed 11th at the WGI Midwest Regionals and
                  7th at the Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championships.

                  The corps played for President Jimmy Carter while he was traveling down the Mississippi River on the Delta Queen. Drum Major Dave Kapp shook
                  hands with President Carter at which point the President said the corps "sounded great."

                  The corps established the Robert M. Buelow Award. The award paid special tribute to Bob for his 17 years of service to the corps and was
                  awarded to the person who "contributed leadership, loyalty and personal commitment to the Colts Drum and Bugle Corps during the preceding
                  years." The first recipient of the Robert M. Buelow award was Gene Steichen. The Colts Winter Guard experienced another tough season,

                  The goal for the season was to attain Associate Member (top 25) status at the DCI Championships. At the championships in Birmingham, AL the
                  corps placed 28th. Though the members were disappointed they knew they had put on the best show they were capable of. They did not make
                  Associate Membership that year but they did find out that they could achieve as a group if they all shared a common attitude and approach.
                  They also had a lot of fun doing it.

                  In 1981 the Colts took their first major plunge into the world of public relations. The corps sponsored the World Premier of the movie "Take
                  This Job and Shove It" in Dubuque, as well as the Carson and Barnes Circus. 32,000 flyers announcing the circus had been sent to most of the
                  homes in Dubuque. It was after the printing and subsequent delivery of these flyers that a printing error was discovered identifying the Colts
                  as the "Colts Drug and Bugle Corps".
                </p>
                <p>The corps purchased three used buses. They were named the Poseidon, the Lusitania and the Titanic by the corps.</p>

                  1981 was the first year the Colts embarked on two tours. The first tour was to the Southern states with the corps performing shows in
                  Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It was during this tour that the corps found out that it had lost its lease at the Colts Building.

                  During the second tour the corps made the finals night performances at the US Open, DCI North and DCI Canada shows for the first time in many
                  years. The Colts finished 28th at the DCI Championships in Montreal.

                      influx of members came in from elsewhere (i.e. Chicagoland area, Omaha and Texas). The corps continued to strengthen the "family"
                      atmosphere and the audience oriented shows. Before the DCI Canada show the corps had a talk about getting too involved in the competitive
                      aspects of drum corps. The members were directed to do what they do best-perform.
                    </p>
                    <p>Future Director Greg Orwoll joined the staff.</p>
                    <p>
                      At the DCI Championships in Montreal the corps reached its season goal and placed in the top 25 with a 24th place finish. This was the
                      highest placement to date.
                    </p>

                      Dave Lang took top honors at the DCI Individual contest on baritone and at the end of the season Greg "Harpo" Blum's soprano was retired.
                      Greg was known throughout the drum corps activity as one of the finest soprano soloists.

                  The Colts were innovators in the 1983 season. The corps introduced the complete show design for the first time in drum corps history. The
                  "Mississippi Suite" used different songs to tell a story. The show utilized props to tell the story. The corps started slowly and were
                  battling the competition bug until the props were added. At a show in North Carolina the crowd reaction to the show and a second place finish
                  caused an attitude change. The crowd, feeling the Colts should have won, booed the Colts second place finish. This showed the members that
                  numbers and placement do not matter. It was how you, as a member, felt after a performance. The sound of a crowd and the memories of
                  performing to one's utmost abilities are everlasting, number and placement is not.
                </p>
                <p>This attitude change helped the corps finish 22nd at the DCI Championships in Miami.</p>

                  In 1984 the Colts were the "Kings of Swing". The corps fielded drum corps first trap set line. Four trap sets were placed in the pit and
                  became a trademark of the Colts. The trap sets were in line with the up-beat, swing show being presented.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The corps purchased used horns from the bankrupt Memphis Blues Brass Band. They were brass, like the instruments purchased in 1977. All the
                  horns were two valve, bringing the corps into "modern" drum corps equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The corps placed 23rd at the DCI Championships in Atlanta, GA. Dave Lang won the DCI Individual contest on baritone and received the Jim Ott
                  Scholarship Award.

                  At the end of the 1984 season, after 7 years as director, Jim Mason left to become the director of the new Star of Indiana Drum and Bugle
                  Corps.

                  The corps continued in the swing tradition bringing back many of the songs from the previous year along with the trap set line. The Colts
                  surprised many people with their crowd oriented show. The question on the drum corps tour this year was "Who are the Colts?".
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a tour through Texas and the east coast the corps went to Madison, WI for the DCI Championships. The Colts surprised everybody and
                  answered who they were with a 16th place finish.
                </p>
                <p>During the summer the corps was proclaimed "Iowa's Ambassadors of Music" by Governor Terry Branstad.</p>

                  Thanks to Bill Cook, founder of the Star of Indiana in Bloomington, IN, the corps received new uniforms. The corps proper uniforms were cadet
                  style with black pants and shoes. The jacket had a white shoulder and collar, with a pyramid of colors (Burgundy, Red, Orange, Yellow) and
                  mustard yellow sleeves. The hat had the same pyramid of colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The motto for 1986 was "New look, new sound, new direction". The Colts were continuously challenged; fan expectation, adverse practice
                  conditions, long bus rides, multiplicity of bus breakdowns, a difficult show, and most importantly, a new look, sound and direction came
                  forth.
                </p>
                <p>The corps kept the swing style show and trap set line.</p>
                <p>At the DCI Championships in Madison, WI the corps placed 20th and lived up to their new image of being "Iowa's Corps".</p>

                  The corps celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 1987 continuing with a jazz based show. The corps dropped the trap set line, which had been in
                  place since 1984.

                      A change in the musical arrangers brought a different approach to jazz to the Colts. The corps was comprised of 75% Iowa high school and
                      college students.

                      Except for the contras, all the horns, which had been brass colored since 1984, were hand chrome-plated at a fender shop in Dubuque.
                      Sequins were added to the uniform to help create more flash in the corps.

                      After touring the Midwest, East Coast and Canada the corps went to Kansas City, MO for the DCI Championships where they placed 18th. In an
                      unusual placement change for finals week, the Colts moved from 21st place to 18th in two days.

                  The jazz style continued into 1989 with the largest hornline in corps history so far at 54 members. The corps also had 22 in the color guard,
                  31 in the percussion section and 1 drum major.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though the concept of the show was well conceived, the final product did not produce the desired effect. The corps performed a 21st place
                  finish at the DCI Championships in Kansas City.

                  Though there had been foreign members participate in the corps in previous years, a record eight foreign members traveled to Dubuque to be a
                  part of the Colts.

                  Misfortune struck the annual Music on the March show in Dubuque when 90 minutes into the show the skies opened and drenched the area in 3/4 of
                  an inch of rain. 15 buses were stuck in a quagmire and 5 tow trucks were needed until 3:00 am to remove the buses and support vehicles. The
                  show became known as "Music in the Mud" for years to come. It so happened that the show announcer was the local meteorologist. He moved out of
                  town soon after the show.

                  The 1990 season was a rebuilding year in the Colts organization. A major changeover in staff, the mass exodus of members in the off-season and
                  a change in the recruiting approach presented challenges throughout the season for the staff and 83 members.
                </p>
                <p>
                  New uniforms were purchased this year. A red tunic with a white sash from the left shoulder to the right hip with silver sequins, the black
                  pants from the previous year made up the corps proper uniform in addition to the white shakos from the previous year with the pyramid in
                  silver. The contras were chrome-plated to complete the transition to silver horns.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The show took a new direction with "New Age-Classical" as the theme. The music was new age and classical in nature but arranged in a jazz
                  fashion. This was one of the early years that drum corps began exploring New Age music in the activity.
                </p>
                <p>The corps was challenged throughout the season and placed 23rd at the DCI Championships in Buffalo, NY.</p>
                <p>
                  This was the turning point in the modern era of the Colts. The philosophy was clarified and a 5-year-plan was put in place for program, staff
                  and membership development. A new priority was made to march only the members who wanted to be a Colt.

                  As an outgrowth of 1990's refocusing, 1991 saw the restructuring of the member responsibilities and approach to rehearsing and performing,
                  while still keeping the focus of the corps toward entertaining the audience, educating the member and keeping a family atmosphere about the
                  corps that had been in place for many years. The staff was solidified to help foster this philosophy.

                  The music continued in the New Age/Contemporary vein presenting "The Four Seasons". Music represented the changing of the seasons. In Madison,

                  The corps celebrated its 30th Anniversary in 1993. As part of the celebration the corps sponsored a parade in conjunction with the local
                  community theater's production of "The Music Man". The grand marshal of the parade was Mrs. Meredith Willson. The corps that were performing
                  in the evening show participated in the parade. This parade was televised live for 1 hour and, according to the Dubuque Police Department,
                  attracted the largest crowd to witness a parade in Dubuque in modern times.

                  The modern day Colts Alumni Association was formed, and the Colts Hall of Fame was established in 1993. The Hall of Fame is a way to recognize
                  the people who have been a vital part of the Colts history. Inductees were Eldon "Fritz" Biver, Bob Buelow, Dick Fox, Harlow Haas, Clarence
                  Hagge, Mel Hein and Merle Mathis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The corps purchased 10 new three-valve mellophones in the first phase of updating the equipment. This was the first section of instruments to
                  be replaced since 1984 and the first brand new instruments since 1977. Many of the horns being used were older than the members. Sabian
                  Cymbals provided a full endorsement to the corps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The show was a continuation of "The Four Seasons" with some modifications in the musical selections. The corps played "Summertime" for the
                  first time since 1982.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a tour of the Midwest and South the corps traveled to Jackson, MS for the DCI Championships. Extremely hot temperatures greeted the
                  corps. The Colts rose to the occasion and surprised everybody with a 12th place finish. This was also a pleasant surprise for the staff and
                  members as well since they had set a goal of placing in the top 17 (semi-finalists) at the beginning of the season. This jump in the
                  standings, 20th place in 1992 to 12th in 1993, is one of the largest in the history of DCI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire finals week the corps kept the attitude that had been in place since 1978 of entertaining the audience and having fun. The day
                  before the quarterfinal show the whole corps took time off to take in a movie.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the 1993 season the corps was awarded the "Most Improved Corps" Award by the directors of Drum Corps Midwest and Greg Orwoll was voted
                  the "Director of the Year" by DCM.

                      Following the success of the 1993 season the corps was on new ground. None of the members and very few of the staff had ever been a part
                      of a finalist corps. Higher expectations from the audience and judging community were new to the Colts.
                    </p>
                    <p>Membership applications rose dramatically due to the top 12 placement in 1993. The Colts fielded a corps of 125 members.</p>
                    <p>
                      The corps purchased 20 new three valve soprano bugles. The battery percussion instruments were provided by Pearl Corporation in the corps
                      first full endorsement package for percussion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The show was designed with high energy in mind. The jazz based show saw the entire corps performing high velocity drill throughout. The
                      demanding show was one of the crowd favorites throughout the summer. After battling for the last finalist spot throughout much of the
                      second tour the Colts managed to hold on to 12th place by nipping the home town Boston Crusaders by tenths of a point at the DCI
                      Championships in Boston, MA to retain the elite top 12 status.

                      1995 saw the number of membership applications rise again with six members coming from Japan. A record number of potential members
                      attended the first rehearsal. There were also a record number of age-outs with 17 members marching their final year. The corps also hit an
                      all time high with the average age being over 19 years old.

                      A combination of the control in 1993 and the entertainment of 1994 was combined in the corps productions of Stephen Sondheim's "Sunday in
                      the Park With George". The goal was to challenge the members emotionally, rather than physically. A "down" ending topped off a show.
                    </p>
                    <p>The operating budget was over $400,000. The corps purchased 10 new Yamaha tubas that can be converted to the key of G.</p>
                    <p>
                      The experience of being a top 12 corps taught the members and staff a lot about why the Colts exist. Everybody took a step back and
                      refocused the direction of the corps. The pressures of the previous year were discarded and the entertaining, educational approach was
                      reiterated. This refocusing produced the most successful year, placement wise, in Colts history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The corps finished 9th at the DCI Championships in Buffalo, NY and member retention continued to increase, but most importantly, in
                      keeping with the Colts tradition, the members were provided a safe, fun, educational experience.

                      The corps made an early season trip to the east coast performing in Drum Corps East contests for the first time. The Colts also
                      participated in the Bristol, RI 4th of July Parade, which has been in existence for over 200 hundred years. Over the course of the summer

                      The Colts eclipsed the 1995 age-out class with a record 31 people marching their final year with the corps. There were also three European
                      and two Japanese members. An age-out choir was organized and sang the national anthem in DeKalb, IL and in Orlando, FL at the Division
                      II/III Finals.

                      A partnership between Drum Corps International and Disney Corp. brought the DCI World Championships to the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, FL.
                      Finalist corps from the previous year participated in a parade around the lagoon at Epcot Center. All corps were given passes to Disney
                      parks.

                    <p>After battling with many corps throughout the season, the corps placed 11th at the finals competition.</p>

                      After 1996's left hand turn in music selection, the music vehicle did a spin out and produced "The Music of Blood, Sweat and Tears". The
                      loud, wild, in-your-face production proved to be very popular with audiences across the country.

                      Once again the World Championships were held in Orlando, FL. The Colts placed 13th at the championships, one place out of finals for the
                      first time since 1992.

                      The corps had 11 age-outs. This was also the first time the corps had a two-time age-out. A recent rule change allowed 22 year olds to
                      march, provided they turned 22 during the summer. Jessica Bibb was eligible for this rule but opted to age-out at 21 in 1996. With two
                      weeks left in the season a member had to leave tour. It would ave been extremely difficult to work a new member, with no experience, into
                      the show in the short amount of time before finals week. Jessica was traveling with the corps as a cook. She was persuaded to come out of
                      "retirement" to fill the newly opened spot. After three days of rehearsal she was in the show and made her final appearance as a Colt,
                      again.

                      The corps started defining the "Colts Style" this season with the A Capella Show. More emphasis on marching and on technique came into
                      play this season.

                      The corps had an exciting season this year, with many new experiences. After free day in Montreal, and on the way to the show that night,
                      the 3 buses were in an accident. Six people were sent to the hospital, and the rest of the corps went to the stadium. All of the other
                      corps pitched in and helped us regain our footing, donating food, buses, and time. One of the special moments was Phantom Regiment playing
                      Amazing Grace for the corps, and a show sponsor giving proceeds to the Colts. The members and staff pulled together, and the family was
                      made tighter. Finals were held in Orlando for the last year, and the corps finished strong. Once again we were given passes to Disney
                      World. However, since the corps had fallen out of finals the year before, the corps did a Parade and standstill in the Magic Kingdom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It was an exciting week for all the corps, battling for the finals. Seeded eleventh, the Colts held on, and placed twelfth finals night.

                      The corps carried the momentum from the 1998 season into this year. The Colts "style" became even more prominent this year, both on and
                      off the field.

                      Cornfield was extended this year, to give the corps a chance to get the show completely on the field. The corps completed the DCM tour
                      placing 5th at DeKalb. After a short, but relaxing break, the Colts returned for a hectic DCI tour. Almost never in the same city twice,
                      they had a exciting schedule. While traveling to a rehearsal day before the Denver, Colorado show, the kitchen truck caught fire. Luckily
                      they stayed in a town in Nebraska that pitched in and donated time, money, and supplies so the kitchen truck could rejoin the corps.

                      Record heat struck at the end of July, following the corps from Illinois to Murphfreesboro for the DCI Midwest Regional. The corps
                      rehearsed at night, so they didn't have to be in the heat for most of the time in the south. They traveled to Allentown for the next
                      regional, and to be on the East Coast for a time. The Colts had the opportunity to perform at the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. with
                      The Blue Knights, and Madison Scouts, and the Drum Majors participated in the ceremony at The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

                    <p>
                      After a show in Virginia, it was time to head for Madison for DCI Championships! Instead of the usual parade, DCI had all the corps
                      participate in the opening ceremonies. It was a sight to see all the corps on the field, and a combined brass line in the back field
                      playing "America/Oh Canada." The week went very fast. On Wednesday a number of participants went to Solo/Ensemble contest. Later that
                      night, the corps found out they had a World Champion Cymbal Line. Consisting of Mark Sulzer, Heather Stoner, Susan Stockseth, Lauren Paul,
                      Adam Steffen, and Ryan Whitehouse, the line had a score of 97 out of 100. Following a great week, the corps had great performances every
                      night, and one of the Colts best performances at Finals. Placing 12th was a great feeling, but everybody was just happy to be in Finals,
                      and be together and perform one last time.

                      Following the largest age-out class in Colts history, this ended up being a transition year for the corps. The staff was mostly new as
                      well as the membership, providing an exciting and energetic atmosphere. The show was also one of the most demanding and ambitious Colts
                      performances, encouraging a well-deserved leap in the competitive side of the Colts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The sheer youth of the corps was impressive. The average age of membership was near 17.5. Corps experience was also low. This lead to
                      early-season struggles that were different from previous years. Eventually the corps became the family that the Colts are known for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Stephen Melillo's energetic music and Al Smith's abstract drill combined for a great early-season surge and interest in the corps
                      community. The new uniforms, designed by Michael Cesario, added to the new Colts attitude. Visual staff introduced a new marching style
                      that looked crisp and sharp, and SCV's Jim Casella (known for innovative, challenging drum writing) wrote the percussion book.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Things kept looking up for the Colts as the season progressed. Three weeks before finals, the Colts were in the middle of a pack of five
                      corps competing for four spots in the big dance. It came down to the last week once again, but this time it was not enough. Semi-finals
                      were as close as the corps would get, placing 14th. With almost 85% of the corps eligible to return in 2001, everyone excitedly looks
                      toward summertime.

                      The corps members returned home, to Dubuque, for the 2000 banquet, which was hosted in the new Colts Community Center, the first property
                      the corps had owned. Coincidentally, the building is the same building the 1981 Colts had lost their lease.

                  With most of the staff and members returning from the 2000 season, it was easy to pick up from where the corps left off the previous year. The
                  Colts welcomed some new members to the staff this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Brian Greenleaf came in as the new Colorguard caption head, and Michael James was the Colorguard designer. Brett Hall came back to the brass
                  staff this year, but in the position of caption head. The Colts also welcomed Dr. Mike Robinson in as the new Music Coordinator, and Michael
                  Klesch wrote a wonderful and well written and exciting brass book. Mark Smith (percussion caption head) and Ryan Thomas wrote an intense and
                  innovative percussion book this year as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All season, the Colts were performing at a higher level than was achieved in previous years. One memorable event was beating the Madison
                  Scouts for the first time in corps history at the BOA Normal, IL show. At the DCI regionals in San Antonio, TX, and in Indianapolis, IN, the
                  corps finished 11th. In Clifton, NJ, the corps came within .1 of their highest score ever with an 87.2. Individuals in the corps also
                  performed at higher levels, at the Individual and Ensemble contest which took place on the Wednesday of Finals week. Soprano Jessie Smith took
                  top honors in the French Horn division, and many other members participated in I&E. On Quarterfinals night, the corps finished 10th because of
                  penalties assessed to the Madison Scouts and Carolina Crown. On Semifinals night, the corps placed 12th, regaining Top 12 status. This meant
                  that the corps got to march on Saturday night at Finals. This was an experience that many members of the corps had yet to have, making the
                  evening that more special.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, the corps grew more as a family and matured more as a performing organization than in the past.</p>
