                <p>Originally founded as the "Junior Dukes" in 1963 by  American Legion Post #6 in Dubuque as a junior corps for students in the tri-state area, the Colts have grown to become one of the longest lived and most consistently successful drum corps in the activity. In 1967, the organization began a Cadet corps for younger students in the area. Going through many name and identity changes throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the organization finally landed on the name "Colts" for the older corps and "Colt Cadets" for the younger corps in 1976. That same year, the Colts sponsored a winter guard that quickly earned national acclaim. The guard captured the prestigious Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship, and later that year won the V.F.W. National Color Guard Championship.</p>
                <p>Since then, the organization has grown considerably, and annually impacts more than 500 students through the two drum corps, summer band, and steel drum ensembles, as well as thousands of fans who see the groups perform every season. The Colts have experienced significant competitive success, placing in the Top 12 at the Drum Corps International World Championships eight times since 1993 and in the Top 25 every year since 1982. The Colts Cadets have also had competitive success, placing in the Top 12 at the Drum Corps International Open Class Championships seven times since 2010.</p>
                <p>The Colts mission, "We use music and excellence to teach each other about success in life," is the driving force behind all the programs offered and pushes the organization to consantly provide the best student experience in the activity.</p>

								<p class="no-margin-top"><strong>Drum Major: Barry Buelow</strong></p>
           					    <p>In the spring of 1963, after hosting a drum corps show for several 
                                  years, the American Legion Post in Dubuque decided to start it's 
                                  own junior corps. A committee was appointed to form a junior corps. 
                                  An ad in the paper asked for boys interested to come to a meeting 
                                  at the American Legion Hall. The boys were given old bugles and 
                                  drums from the senior corps. The adult corps was known as the "Dukes 
                                  of Dubuque" so the corps adopted the name "The Junior Dukes".</p>
                                <p>The first uniform of the Junior Dukes consisted of black pants 
                                  and shoes and a white shirt- all furnished by the corps members. 
                                  Members were furnished with a black and white overseas cap with 
                                  a red tassel.</p>
                                <p>The name "Junior Dukes" appeared on the hat. They also wore a bolo 
                                tie with the Dubuque Packing Company "Fleur de lis" on it.
                                </p>
                                <p>The 
                                  Junior Dukes consisted of 38 boys, of which there were 24 horns, 
                                  10 drums, 2 flags and 2 guards for the American Flag. Anyone who 
                                  couldn't play an instrument was a guard on the American Flag, also 
                                  because of limited equipment.</p>
                                <p>The first two years the corps was a parade unit. Dick Davis taught 
                                  horns, drums and marching. In 1964, Clarence Hagge started to teach 
                                  the Junior Dukes horns and marching.</p>
                                <p>The Dukes of Dubuque folded in 1964 and the senior group lost interest. 
                                  At that time Clarence Hagge, Dick Davis and Bob Buelow took over 
                                  the corps. With the folding of the senior corps the junior corps 
                                  considered a name change. Thus it was that the "Legionnaires" took 
                                  the field in 1965.</p>

                                    <p>This was the first year the corps marched under the name "Legionnaires."</p> 
                                      <p>It is interesting to note that some show programs called the corps 
                                      The Dubuquers or spelled the name Legion Aires or Legionaires or 
                                      Legionnaires.</p>
                                    <p>Only 15 of the 48 boys who marched in 1964 returned. The corps 
                                      attempted to recruit 13 to 15 year olds instead of 16 year olds 
                                      because they felt they could keep them involved longer. The corps 
                                      numbered 42 this year.</p>
                                    <p>The corps uniform consisted of black long sleeve shirts, a white 
                                      scarf, black pants and black shoes.</p>
                                    <p>This was the only year the corps marched under the name Legionnaires 
                                      in which only boys participated. Girls were added to the membership 
                                      in the fall of 1965.</p>

              							<p>There were 75 members in the corps this year ranging from 11 to 
                                        16 years old. They wore black western uniforms and the color guard 
                                        wore white shirts, a black skirt and boots. The first trophy ever won by the corps was a second place in the 
                                        Hazel Green, WI parade.</p>

                                    <p>The corps made several parade appearances in Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin 
                                      as members of The Iowa American Legion Sponsored Uniformed Group 
                                      (IALSUG), Badgerland Drum and Bugle Corps Association, Mid-American 
                                      Drum and Bugle Corps Circuit and the Midwest Color Guard Circuit.</p>
                                    <p>This year the corps had 80 members with an average age of 16. The 
                                      Cadets were formed in the fall of 1967 as a feeder corps for the 
                                      "A" corps. At that time they were called the "A" corps and the "B" 
                                      corps. Sonia Hickson was the first director of the Cadets, assisted 
                                      by members of the "A" corps.</p>

                                        <p>The Legionnaires were incorporated as a non-profit organization this 
                                          year and had an operating budget of $13,000. The corps fielded 83 
                                          members, while the Cadets fielded 80.</p>
                                        <p>1968 was the first full year of competition. The corps traveled 
                                          over 4000 miles this year and were honored with a day set aside 
                                          as recognition day to show Dubuque that the corps was a special 
                                          benefit to the city by the example it set.</p>
                                        <p>The corps brought home 8 first place and 4 second place trophies, 
                                          including the 1968 State American Legion Junior Color Guard Championship. 
                                          The City of Dubuque proclaimed the Legionnaires the "Junior Ambassadors

                                        <p>The name change to the Colt .45 became official on November 14, 
                                          1968. The change was due primarily to the corps desiring to perform/compete 
                                          in a greater variety of shows other than Legion sponsored events.</p>
                                        <p>This was the first year the Colt .45 adopted its all western uniforms 
                                          and music. The uniforms consisted of black and white fringed shirts, 
                                          black or white pants and black, pleated skirts with white inlays 
                                          for the color guard. Red ties and pettipants and cowboy boots and 
                                          hats completed the uniforms.</p>
                                        <p>The corps competed in Class A competition for the first time and 
                                          won almost every contest in which they entered. The corps participated 
                                          in 18 events with stops in Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan.

                                        They finished 1st in 6 contests and captured the Championship Title 
                                        at the Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championship in Elmhurst, IL. The 
                                        VFW National Color Guard Championship in New York City was their next 
                                        competition. The Colts Competition Guard was declared the 1976 VFW 
                                        National Color Guard Champions and scored the highest number of points 
                                        in the history of the VFW National Guard Championships. The entire 
                                        Colts Color Guard was named the 1976 VFW National Color Guard Parade 
                                        Champions. A few days later at the DCI Color Guard Championship the 
                                        guard took 3rd place.</p>

                                        <p>The 1977 corps was the largest in history to date with 120 members, 
                                          of which only 9 were from outside of the Dubuque area. The Cadets 
                                          fielded 61 members.</p>
                                        <p>New uniforms were purchased. They consisted of an orange riverboat 
                                          gambler style formal jacket with a white ruffled shirt and black 
                                          tie with black pants worm by the horns and drums. The color guard 
                                          had gold jackets and black skirts and all sections wore a round 
                                          black gambler hat. The Competition Guard had two units. At the Midwest 
                                          Color Guard Circuit Championship the Color Guard took second while 
                                          the Colts "Too" took 21st. At the Iowa American Legion State Color 
                                          Guard Championships the Colts won 1st place and Colts "Too" second 
                                          place. At the American Legion Color Guard Championship in Denver 
                                          the Colts finished 2nd while the Colts "Too" finished 4th. The Colts 
                                          won the VFW National Color Guard Championship held in Minneapolis.</p>
                                         <p>The corps placed 26th at the DCI Championships in Denver, but due 
                                          to the disqualification of the Bridgemen the Colts officially placed 
                                          25th. At the American Legion Championships in Golden, CO the corps 
                                          placed 12th.</p>

                                        <p>1978 marked the first year of the World Guard International Competition 
                                          and the Colts guard finished 4th. The guard also finished 3rd at 
                                          the Midwest Color Guard Finals.</p>
                                        <p>The corps purchased new bugles in December of 1977. The sopranos 
                                          and baritones were the new two valve variety and the mellophones, 
                                          french horns and contras were the old single piston. The total purchase 
                                          cost $21,354 for 63 horns. The instruments had a brass lacquer finish. 
                                          Only two other corps used this type of horn. The theory behind the 
                                          brass horn was that it created a darker tone when played. The Colts 
                                          season found the corps trying to recover from the largest turnover 
                                          ever recorded in corps history. The corps barely missed Associate 
                                          Membership again by placing 27th at the DCI Championships in Denver, 
                                          CO.</p>
                                        <p>Although the goal of becoming an Associate Member in DCI was not 
                                          met, the season proved to be very interesting for all of the marching 
                                          members. Because of the huge turnover in membership the corps needed 
                                          a couple months to find itself and the reasons why it was putting 
                                          in 12 to 15 hour days. The reason became clear when the corps left 
                                          on tour. A recent corps tradition, that of a family atmosphere, 
                                          started to develop and the days of work and sacrifice became worthwhile 
                                          as the realization set in. Not only was the work paying off in self 
                                          satisfaction, but there also developed the notion of trying just 
                                          because you knew the person next to you was putting out 100%.</p>
                                         <p>It was this feeling of being a family that let every member take 
                                          satisfaction in some of the accomplishments that were awarded to 
                                          individual members. Among these accomplishments include: Bob Vasquez 
                                          being named 3rd runner-up for Best Drum Major of the Year by Drum 
                                          Corps World and Jolene Miller-O'Toole was named Color Guard Captain

                                       <p>The year started with a new uniform look for the drum line. Off 
                                          came the orange jackets to be replaced by bright yellow vests and 
                                          black garter belts. The guard utilized the orange jackets with black 
                                          leotards and tights. The rifle line also presented a new look by 
                                          donning red vests during certain parts of the show. The corps also 
                                          had 27 new flags.</p>
                                       <p>1979 proved to be another trying year for the Colts, a fact compounded 
                                          by yet another large turnover in membership. Also, due to financial 
                                          problems the corps didn't tour extensively but did travel to the 
                                          DCI Championships in Birmingham, AL and placed 35th. The guard was 
                                          especially hard hit by membership turnover with no less than 27 
                                          new members. Even with this turnover they placed 11th at the WGI 
                                          Midwest Regionals and 7th at the Midwest Color Guard Circuit Championships.</p>
                                        <p>The corps played for President Jimmy Carter while he was traveling 
                                          down the Mississippi River on the Delta Queen. Drum Major Dave Kapp 
                                          shook hands with President Carter at which point the President said 
                                          the corps "sounded great".</p>

                                          the preceding years." The first recipient of the Robert M. Buelow 
                                          award was Gene Steichen. The Colts Winter Guard experienced another

                                          AL the corps placed 28th. Though the members were disappointed they

                                          not make Associate Membership that year but they did find out that 
                                          they could achieve as a group if they all shared a common attitude

                                        <p>The Cadets had 33 members.</p>
                                        <p>In 1981 the Colts took their first major plunge into the world 
                                          of public relations. The corps sponsored the World Premier of the 
                                          movie "Take This Job and Shove It" in Dubuque, as well as the Carson 
                                          and Barnes Circus. 32,000 flyers announcing the circus had been 
                                          sent to most of the homes in Dubuque. It was after the printing 
                                          and subsequent delivery of these flyers that a printing error was 
                                          discovered identifying the Colts as the "Colts Drug and Bugle Corps".</p>
                                        <p>The corps purchased three used buses. They were named the Poseidon, 
                                          the Lusitania and the Titanic by the corps.</p>
                                        <p>1981 was the first year the Colts embarked on two tours. The first 
                                          tour was to the Southern states with the corps performing shows 
                                          in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It was during this tour that the 
                                          corps found out that it had lost its lease at the Colts Building.</p>
                                        <p>During the second tour the corps made the finals night performances 
                                          at the US Open, DCI North and DCI Canada shows for the first time 
                                          in many years. The Colts finished 28th at the DCI Championships 
                                          in Montreal.</p>
                                        <p>On August 5, 1981 the Colts moved into the lower level of the Fischer 
                                          Arcade building, where the bingo hall existed until 2000.</p>

                                        <p>The 1982 Colts can be considered a significant turning point in 
                                          the Colts History. After a slow start during the winter season a 
                                          large influx of members came in from elsewhere (i.e. Chicagoland 
                                          area, Omaha and Texas). The corps continued to strengthen the "family" 
                                          atmosphere and the audience oriented shows. Before the DCI Canada 
                                          show the corps had a talk about getting too involved in the competitive 
                                          aspects of drum corps. The members were directed to do what they 
                                          do best-perform.</p>
                                        <p>Future Director Greg Orwoll joined the staff.</p>
                                        <p>At the DCI Championships in Montreal the corps reached its season 
                                          goal and placed in the top 25 with a 24th place finish. This was 
                                          the highest placement to date.</p>
                                        <p>Dave Lang took top honors at the DCI Individual contest on baritone 
                                          and at the end of the season Greg "Harpo" Blum's soprano was retired. 
                                          Greg was known throughout the drum corps activity as one of the 
                                          finest soprano soloists.</p>

                                        <p>The Colts were innovators in the 1983 season. The corps introduced 
                                          the complete show design for the first time in drum corps history. 
                                          The "Mississippi Suite" used different songs to tell a story. The 
                                          show utilized props to tell the story. The corps started slowly 
                                          and were battling the competition bug until the props were added. 
                                          At a show in North Carolina the crowd reaction to the show and a 
                                          second place finish caused an attitude change. The crowd, feeling 
                                          the Colts should have won, booed the Colts second place finish. 
                                          This showed the members that numbers and placement do not matter. 
                                          It was how you, as a member, felt after a performance. The sound 
                                          of a crowd and the memories of performing to one's utmost abilities 
                                          are everlasting, number and placement is not.</p>
                                        <p>This attitude change helped the corps finish 22nd at the DCI Championships 
                                          in Miami.</p>

                                       <p>In 1984 the Colts were the "Kings of Swing". The corps fielded 
                                          drum corps first trap set line. Four trap sets were placed in the 
                                          pit and became a trademark of the Colts. The trap sets were in line 
                                          with the up-beat, swing show being presented.</p>
                            			<p>The corps purchased used horns from the bankrupt Memphis Blues 
                                          Brass Band. They were brass, like the instruments purchased in 1977. 
                                          All the horns were two valve, bringing the corps into "modern" drum

                                        <p>The corps celebrated its 25th Anniversary in 1987 continuing with 
                                          a jazz based show. The corps dropped the trap set line, which had 
                                          been in place since 1984.</p>
                                        <p>The corps traveled to Denver, the south and midwest. The Colts 
                                          finished 20th at the DCI Championships in Madison, WI.</p>

                                        <p>A change in the musical arrangers brought a different approach 
                                          to jazz to the Colts. The corps was comprised of 75% Iowa high school 
                                          and college students.</p>
                                        <p>Except for the contras, all the horns, which had been brass colored 
                                          since 1984, were hand chrome-plated at a fender shop in Dubuque. 
                                          Sequins were added to the uniform to help create more flash in the 
                                          corps.</p>
                                        <p>After touring the Midwest, East Coast and Canada the corps went 
                                          to Kansas City, MO for the DCI Championships where they placed 18th. 
                                          In an unusual placement change for finals week, the Colts moved 
                                          from 21st place to 18th in two days.</p>
                                        <p>This year also saw the Colts defeat the rival Troopers for the 
                                          first time in corps history.</p>

                                        <p>The jazz style continued into 1989 with the largest hornline in 
                                          corps history so far at 54 members. The corps also had 22 in the 
                                          color guard, 31 in the percussion section and 1 drum major.</p>
                                        <p>Though the concept of the show was well conceived, the final product 
                                          did not produce the desired effect. The corps performed a 21st place 
                                          finish at the DCI Championships in Kansas City.</p>
                                        <p>Though there had been foreign members participate in the corps 
                                          in previous years, a record eight foreign members traveled to Dubuque 
                                          to be a part of the Colts.</p>
                                        <p>Misfortune struck the annual Music on the March show in Dubuque 
                                          when 90 minutes into the show the skies opened and drenched the 
                                          area in 3/4 of an inch of rain. 15 buses were stuck in a quagmire 
                                          and 5 tow trucks were needed until 3:00 am to remove the buses and 
                                          support vehicles. The show became known as "Music in the Mud" for 
                                          years to come. It so happened that the show announcer was the local 
                                          meteorologist. He moved out of town soon after the show.</p>

                                        <p>The 1990 season was a rebuilding year in the Colts organization. 
                                          A major changeover in staff, the mass exodus of members in the off-season 
                                          and a change in the recruiting approach presented challenges throughout 
                                          the season for the staff and 83 members.</p>
                            			<p>New uniforms were purchased this year. A red tunic with a white 
                                          sash from the left shoulder to the right hip with silver sequins, 
                                          the black pants from the previous year made up the corps proper 
                                          uniform in addition to the white shakos from the previous year with 
                                          the pyramid in silver. The contras were chrome-plated to complete 
                                          the transition to silver horns.</p>
                                        <p>The show took a new direction with "New Age-Classical" as the theme. 
                                          The music was new age and classical in nature but arranged in a 
                                          jazz fashion. This was one of the early years that drum corps began 
                                          exploring New Age music in the activity.</p>
                                        <p>The corps was challenged throughout the season and placed 23rd 
                                          at the DCI Championships in Buffalo, NY.</p>
                                        <p>This was the turning point in the modern era of the Colts. The 
                                          philosophy was clarified and a 5-year-plan was put in place for 
                                          program, staff and membership development. A new priority was made 
                                          to march only the members who wanted to be a Colt.</p>

                                        <p>As an outgrowth of 1990's refocusing, 1991 saw the restructuring

                                          while still keeping the focus of the corps toward entertaining the 
                                          audience, educating the member and keeping a family atmosphere about 
                                          the corps that had been in place for many years. The staff was solidified 
                                          to help foster this philosophy.</p>
                                        <p>White pants replaced the black. Volunteers sewed over 90 pair of 
                                          pants over a two month period in preparation for the summer tour.</p>
                                        <p>The show continued with the New Age theme. The demanding show brought 
                                          a 22nd place finish at the DCI Championships in Dallas, TX.</p>

                                        <p>The corps celebrated its 30th Anniversary in 1993. As part of the 
                                          celebration the corps sponsored a parade in conjunction with the 
                                          local community theater's production of "The Music Man". The grand 
                                          marshal of the parade was Mrs. Meredith Willson. The corps that 
                                          were performing in the evening show participated in the parade. 
                                          This parade was televised live for 1 hour and, according to the 
                                          Dubuque Police Department, attracted the largest crowd to witness 
                                          a parade in Dubuque in modern times.</p>
                                        <p>The modern day Colts Alumni Association was formed, and the Colts 
                                          Hall of Fame was established in 1993. The Hall of Fame is a way 
                                          to recognize the people who have been a vital part of the Colts 
                                          history. Inductees were Eldon "Fritz" Biver, Bob Buelow, Dick Fox, 
                                          Harlow Haas, Clarence Hagge, Mel Hein and Merle Mathis.</p>
                                        <p>The corps purchased 10 new three-valve mellophones in the first 
                                          phase of updating the equipment. This was the first section of instruments 
                                          to be replaced since 1984 and the first brand new instruments since 
                                          1977. Many of the horns being used were older than the members. 
                                          Sabian Cymbals provided a full endorsement to the corps.</p>
                                        <p>The show was a continuation of "The Four Seasons" with some modifications 
                                          in the musical selections. The corps played "Summertime" for the 
                                          first time since 1982.</p>
                                        <p>After a tour of the Midwest and South the corps traveled to Jackson, 
                                          MS for the DCI Championships. Extremely hot temperatures greeted 
                                          the corps. The Colts rose to the occasion and surprised everybody 
                                          with a 12th place finish. This was also a pleasant surprise for 
                                          the staff and members as well since they had set a goal of placing 
                                          in the top 17 (semi-finalists) at the beginning of the season. This 
                                          jump in the standings, 20th place in 1992 to 12th in 1993, is one 
                                          of the largest in the history of DCI.</p>
                                        <p>The entire finals week the corps kept the attitude that had been 
                                          in place since 1978 of entertaining the audience and having fun. 
                                          The day before the quarterfinal show the whole corps took time off 
                                          to take in a movie.</p>
                                        <p>After the 1993 season the corps was awarded the "Most Improved 
                                          Corps" Award by the directors of Drum Corps Midwest and Greg Orwoll 
                                          was voted the "Director of the Year" by DCM.</p>

                                        <p>Following the success of the 1993 season the corps was on new ground. 
                                          None of the members and very few of the staff had ever been a part 
                                          of a finalist corps. Higher expectations from the audience and judging 
                                          community were new to the Colts.</p>
                                        <p>Membership applications rose dramatically due to the top 12 placement 
                                          in 1993. The Colts fielded a corps of 125 members.</p>
                                        <p>The corps purchased 20 new three valve soprano bugles. The battery 
                                          percussion instruments were provided by Pearl Corporation in the 
                                          corps first full endorsement package for percussion.</p>
                                        <p>The show was designed with high energy in mind. The jazz based 
                                          show saw the entire corps performing high velocity drill throughout. 
                                          The demanding show was one of the crowd favorites throughout the 
                                          summer. After battling for the last finalist spot throughout much 
                                          of the second tour the Colts managed to hold on to 12th place by 
                                          nipping the home town Boston Crusaders by tenths of a point at the 
                                          DCI Championships in Boston, MA to retain the elite top 12 status.</p>
                                        <p>Inductees into the Colts Hall of Fame in 1994 were Beth Miller 
                                          and Alan Beckius.</p>

                                        <p>1995 saw the number of membership applications rise again with 
                                          six members coming from Japan. A record number of potential members 
                                          attended the first rehearsal. There were also a record number of 
                                          age-outs with 17 members marching their final year. The corps also 
                                          hit an all time high with the average age being over 19 years old.</p>
                                        <p>A combination of the control in 1993 and the entertainment of 1994 
                                          was combined in the corps productions of Stephen Sondheim's "Sunday 
                                          in the Park With George". The goal was to challenge the members 
                                          emotionally, rather than physically. A "down" ending topped off 
                                          a show.</p>
                                        <p>The operating budget was over $400,000. The corps purchased 10 
                                          new Yamaha tubas that can be converted to the key of G.</p>
                                        <p>The experience of being a top 12 corps taught the members and staff 
                                          a lot about why the Colts exist. Everybody took a step back and 
                                          refocused the direction of the corps. The pressures of the previous 
                                          year were discarded and the entertaining, educational approach was 
                                          reiterated. This refocusing produced the most successful year, placement 
                                          wise, in Colts history.</p>
                                        <p>The corps finished 9th at the DCI Championships in Buffalo, NY 
                                          and member retention continued to increase, but most importantly, 
                                          in keeping with the Colts tradition, the members were provided a 
                                          safe, fun, educational experience.</p>
                                        <p>1995 saw Derald and Jean Schrobilgen and Steve Delaney inducted

                                          in Drum Corps East contests for the first time. The Colts also participated

                                          in-between.</p>
                                        <p>The Colts eclipsed the 1995 age-out class with a record 31 people 
                                          marching their final year with the corps. There were also three 
                                          European and two Japanese members. An age-out choir was organized 
                                          and sang the national anthem in DeKalb, IL and in Orlando, FL at

                                        Hi De Ho<br></p>    
                                        <p>After 1996's left hand turn in music selection, the music vehicle 
                                          did a spin out and produced "The Music of Blood, Sweat and Tears". 
                                          The loud, wild, in-your-face production proved to be very popular 
                                          with audiences across the country.</p>
                                        <p>Once again the World Championships were held in Orlando, FL. The 
                                          Colts placed 13th at the championships, one place out of finals 
                                          for the first time since 1992.</p>
                                        <p>The corps had 11 age-outs. This was also the first time the corps 
                                          had a two-time age-out. A recent rule change allowed 22 year olds 
                                          to march, provided they turned 22 during the summer. Jessica Bibb 
                                          was eligible for this rule but opted to age-out at 21 in 1996. With 
                                          two weeks left in the season a member had to leave tour. It would 
                                          ave been extremely difficult to work a new member, with no experience, 
                                          into the show in the short amount of time before finals week. Jessica 
                                          was traveling with the corps as a cook. She was persuaded to come 
                                          out of "retirement" to fill the newly opened spot. After three days 
                                          of rehearsal she was in the show and made her final appearance as 
                                          a Colt, again.</p>

                                        <p>The corps started defining the "Colts Style" this season with the 
                                          A Capella Show. More emphasis on marching and on technique came 
                                          into play this season.</p>
                                        <p>The corps had an exciting season this year, with many new experiences. 
                                          After free day in Montreal, and on the way to the show that night, 
                                          the 3 buses were in an accident. Six people were sent to the hospital, 
                                          and the rest of the corps went to the stadium. All of the other 
                                          corps pitched in and helped us regain our footing, donating food, 
                                          buses, and time. One of the special moments was Phantom Regiment 
                                          playing Amazing Grace for the corps, and a show sponsor giving proceeds 
                                          to the Colts. The members and staff pulled together, and the family 
                                          was made tighter. Finals were held in Orlando for the last year, 
                                          and the corps finished strong. Once again we were given passes to 
                                          Disney World. However, since the corps had fallen out of finals 
                                          the year before, the corps did a Parade and standstill in the Magic 
                                          Kingdom.</p>
                                        <p>It was an exciting week for all the corps, battling for the finals. 
                                          Seeded eleventh, the Colts held on, and placed twelfth finals night.</p>

                                        <p>The corps carried the momentum from the 1998 season into this year. 
                                          The Colts "style" became even more prominent this year, both on 
                                          and off the field.</p>
                                        <p>Cornfield was extended this year, to give the corps a chance to 
                                          get the show completely on the field. The corps completed the DCM 
                                          tour placing 5th at DeKalb. After a short, but relaxing break, the 
                                          Colts returned for a hectic DCI tour. Almost never in the same city 
                                          twice, they had a exciting schedule. While traveling to a rehearsal 
                                          day before the Denver, Colorado show, the kitchen truck caught fire. 
                                          Luckily they stayed in a town in Nebraska that pitched in and donated 
                                          time, money, and supplies so the kitchen truck could rejoin the 
                                          corps.</p>
                                        <p>Record heat struck at the end of July, following the corps from 
                                          Illinois to Murphfreesboro for the DCI Midwest Regional. The corps 
                                          rehearsed at night, so they didn't have to be in the heat for most 
                                          of the time in the south. They traveled to Allentown for the next 
                                          regional, and to be on the East Coast for a time. The Colts had 
                                          the opportunity to perform at the Capitol Building in Washington 
                                          D.C. with The Blue Knights, and Madison Scouts, and the Drum Majors 
                                          participated in the ceremony at The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>
                                        <p>After a show in Virginia, it was time to head for Madison for DCI 
                                          Championships! Instead of the usual parade, DCI had all the corps 
                                          participate in the opening ceremonies. It was a sight to see all 
                                          the corps on the field, and a combined brass line in the back field 
                                          playing "America/Oh Canada." The week went very fast. On Wednesday 
                                          a number of participants went to Solo/Ensemble contest. Later that 
                                          night, the corps found out they had a World Champion Cymbal Line. 
                                          Consisting of Mark Sulzer, Heather Stoner, Susan Stockseth, Lauren 
                                          Paul, Adam Steffen, and Ryan Whitehouse, the line had a score of 
                                          97 out of 100. Following a great week, the corps had great performances 
                                          every night, and one of the Colts best performances at Finals. Placing 
                                          12th was a great feeling, but everybody was just happy to be in 
                                          Finals, and be together and perform one last time.</p>

                                        <p> Following the largest age-out class in Colts history, this ended 
                                          up being a transition year for the corps. The staff was mostly new 
                                          as well as the membership, providing an exciting and energetic atmosphere. 
                                          The show was also one of the most demanding and ambitious Colts 
                                          performances, encouraging a well-deserved leap in the competitive 
                                          side of the Colts.</p>
                                        <p>The sheer youth of the corps was impressive. The average age of 
                                          membership was near 17.5. Corps experience was also low. This lead 
                                          to early-season struggles that were different from previous years. 
                                          Eventually the corps became the family that the Colts are known 
                                          for.</p>
                                        <p>Stephen Melillo's energetic music and Al Smith's abstract drill 
                                          combined for a great early-season surge and interest in the corps 
                                          community. The new uniforms, designed by Michael Cesario, added 
                                          to the new Colts attitude. Visual staff introduced a new marching 
                                          style that looked crisp and sharp, and SCV's Jim Casella (known 
                                          for innovative, challenging drum writing) wrote the percussion book.</p>
                                        <p>Things kept looking up for the Colts as the season progressed. 
                                          Three weeks before finals, the Colts were in the middle of a pack 
                                          of five corps competing for four spots in the big dance. It came 
                                          down to the last week once again, but this time it was not enough. 
                                          Semi-finals were as close as the corps would get, placing 14th. 
                                          With almost 85% of the corps eligible to return in 2001, everyone 
                                          excitedly looks toward summertime.</p>
                                        <p>The Colt Cadets received new horns this year.</p>
                                        <p>The corps members returned home, to Dubuque, for the 2000 banquet, 
                                          which was hosted in the new Colts Community Center, the first property 
                                          the corps had owned. Coincidentally, the building is the same building 
                                          the 1981 Colts had lost their lease.</p>

                                    <p>With most of the staff and members returning from the 2000 season, 
                                      it was easy to pick up from where the corps left off the previous 
                                      year. The Colts welcomed some new members to the staff this year. </p>
                                    <p>Brian Greenleaf came in as the new Colorguard caption head, and 
                                      Michael James was the Colorguard designer. Brett Hall came back 
                                      to the brass staff this year, but in the position of caption head. 
                                      The Colts also welcomed Dr. Mike Robinson in as the new Music Coordinator, 
                                      and Michael Klesch wrote a wonderful and well written and exciting 
                                      brass book. Mark Smith (percussion caption head) and Ryan Thomas 
                                      wrote an intense and innovative percussion book this year as well.</p>
                                    <p>All season, the Colts were performing at a higher level than was 
                                      achieved in previous years. One memorable event was beating the 
                                      Madison Scouts for the first time in corps history at the BOA Normal, 
                                      IL show. At the DCI regionals in San Antonio, TX, and in Indianapolis, 
                                      IN, the corps finished 11th. In Clifton, NJ, the corps came within 
                                      .1 of their highest score ever with an 87.2. Individuals in the 
                                      corps also performed at higher levels, at the Individual and Ensemble 
                                      contest which took place on the Wednesday of Finals week. Soprano 
                                      Jessie Smith took top honors in the French Horn division, and many 
                                      other members participated in I&E. On Quarterfinals night, the 
                                      corps finished 10th because of penalties assessed to the Madison 
                                      Scouts and Carolina Crown. On Semifinals night, the corps placed 
                                      12th, regaining Top 12 status. This meant that the corps got to 
                                      march on Saturday night at Finals. This was an experience that many 
                                      members of the corps had yet to have, making the evening that more 
                                      special. </p>
                                    <p>Overall, the corps grew more as a family and matured more as a 
                                      performing organization than in the past.</p>
