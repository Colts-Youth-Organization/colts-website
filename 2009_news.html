            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">New Horizons Band Beginning in Dubuque!</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>September 16, 2009</i></p>
				<p>Mike Grimes, Colts Operations Director, attended the introduction meeting hosted by John Woodin last Saturday, September 12th in the Colts Center. New Horizons Band is for beginning musicians, soon to be musicians and for seasoned-veteran musicians alike. If you have never played an instrument, but have the desire to learn, this program will be for you! The only catch? You must be at least 50 years old to join.</p>
                <p>New Horizons Music is an international program that provides entry points to music making for adults, including those with no musical experience at all and also those who were active in school music programs but have been inactive for a long period. Many adults would like an opportunity to learn music in a group setting similar to that offered in schools, but the last entry point in most cases was elementary school. New Horizons undertands that for most of the last century, about 15 - 20 percent of high school students nationally participated in music. From that, they can estimate that at least 80 percent of the adult population needs beginning instruction in order to participate in making music. New Horizons Music programs serve that need.</p>
                <p>Stop in during their Open House Saturday, September 26, from 11 am - 1 pm, at Kephart's Music Center on Hwy 20. Try out the band instruments and see what fits you best. Professionals will be there to help. You may purchase or rent to own arrangements may be made through Kepharts. Kepharts will even check out your old instrument to make sure it is still in playable condition.</p>
                <p>Group Lessons Through the Northeast Iowa School of Music for seniors with no musical experience. Small group lessons will begin the first week in October. Nine one-hour lessons are only $95. There is a minimum of three students per group, with time/day arrangements to be made that best fits your schedule. When you feel you are ready to perform, you may join the band.</p>
                <p>If you already play a band insrument you may join the band immediately! Weekly rehearsals are from 6:30 - 7:30 pm Monday evenings at the Colts Center downtown (1101 Central Ave.)Mr. John Woodin will be directing the ensemble. The cost is only $25 for the first 9 weeks, with the first rehearsal on October 5th.</p>
                <p>What happens after the first 9 weeks? This is a pilot program, made possible through a grant from the City of Dubuque. New Horizons fully expects to keep this program going on after the holidays. Additional sessions of lessons and rehearsals will be added with the input of those who participate in the pilot program.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>July 2, 2009</i></p>
      			<p>For the first time ever, the stadium was a near sell out, with over 2,600 on  hand.  We have on hand ONE reserved seat ticket that was not sold, and general admission seats spilled into the grass on either side of the seating and even a few spectators sitting on the back side!</p>
                <p>Music on the March has always been well attended, but always fell 300 to 500 seats short of a full stand.</p>
                <p>The combination of the great line up (six of the top 15 in the world), cool pleasant weather, and the extra publicity the Colts have had all year from the Inaugural Parade, the chance to play for the annual Chamber of Commerce dinner and frankly a better job with promotions all came together.</p>
                <p>The Colts and Cadets continue on tour from here and the Cadets now prepare for some local events in July culminating with Music on the March 2 on Friday, July 31 at Dalzell Field.</p>

            <h1 class="section-title no-margin-top">Colts Receive Two Grants</h1>
		</div>
	</div>
      <p><i>June 12, 2009</i></p>
      			<p>The Dubuque Racing Association is the non profit organization that holds the gambling  authority for the Dubuque Greyhound Park and the Mystique Casino and also licenses the Diamond Jo Casino.</p>
                <p>Their operating charter directs a percentage of profits to non profit organizations every year.  It is a competitive grant process and the Colts were one of nearly 250 agencies to receive funding this year.</p>
                <p>We have received a grant every year but one since this program started in 1987.  In total, since 1987, the Colts have been fortunate to received from the DRA over $240,000 in support of capital investments.</p>
                <p>The City of Dubuque provides operating support for major and established Arts and Culture organizations located in Dubuque who provide year-round programming for Dubuque citizens.  A total of $200,000 is allocated each year in the City budget, and an appointed Arts and Culture commission decides on an allocation to the groups who qualify.</p>
                <p>This is the largest grant the Colts have received from this program since the Dubuque City Council initiated it in 2006.</p>

      <p><i>January 20, 2009</i></p>
      			<p>We left from Dubuque at 3 p.m. on Saturday and arrived at this wonderful campus at Gallaudet University in Washington DC at  7:15 p.m. Sunday night.  Yes, we were supposed to be in at 5:30.... Blizzard conditions with drifting snow from Bettendorf to around Peoria at 35 mph.  Then, freezing rain from Bloomington, IL to Indianapolis, at 45 mph, then ice covered by 3 inches of slush and snow, with wind, from eastern Ohio until mid-Pennsylvania, at 40 mph and then  topping it off, a failed generator on a bus that put us on the side of the thruway in Central  Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>Never a problem only an inconvenience!</p>
                <p>We passed luggage back to the semi, with a 'chain gang' that stretched 200 feet past five other buses, then got back on the bus to grab our personal bus things, then found our seat on one of the other five buses, with room for all using the extra seats we'd planned into our plans as a contingency and moved out in 40 minutes (the bus is already fixed and we'll pick it up on the way home Wednesday morning!).</p>
                <p>We had rehearsal Sunday night, which was the first time we played the music together, learning the all new music we arranged just for the parade and working out the color guard work that was written on an email.</p>  
                <p>We got up this morning at 8 and rehearsed as a full ensemble at 11, with everything together for the first time.</p>
                <p>This afternoon, outside in a little snow flurry, we put the marching program together and by tonight at 11, we were ready for bed, completely ready to be amazing before the world!</p>
                <p>Mayor Roy Buol stopped by today to wish the members well and got to be the first of several million people to hear our music for the parade.</p>
                <p>We've also fit everyone in a uniform, including our new color guard uniforms, specially designed and made for the parade, with everyone looking great, in a total of 22 hours. Custom-made and sewn flags arrived Saturday and the guard uniforms arrived Friday.</p>
                <p>We are in the first division, number 19 in the a parade overall and we will step off at approximately 2:45 p.m. eastern time before the world. We have KWWL television, channel 9, KCRG television channel 7 and the Telegraph Herald traveling with us and filing regular reports and today we had a television crew from British broadcasting stop by to do a story on us for England. Thank you for making this amazing experience possible for us all! Mind Frame theater in Dubuque is showing the entire inaugural starting at 10:30 a.m. including the parade, and most news channels are showing it live as well.</p>
                <p>Proud to be from Dubuque, Iowa, the Colts! 119 in the parade and another 125 in support of the corps and sharing history today! Thank you for your help in making it possible! We're waking the members in an hour!  Wish us well and give us all your support!!</p>
                <p>Secret Service security clearance checks start at 7:30 at the Pentagon!  Here we go! We plan to leave DC at 9:30 Tuesday night following a banquet celebration at the University, and we will arrive home in Dubuque at 10 p.m. on Wednesday night.</p>
                <p>Thursday we'll all be back in school, back at the jobs and getting back to 'real life' but we will all go forward in our lives with a special and lifetime experience that we'll never forget.</p>

We will politely flow through their security systems, and move to the staging areas according to their methods, their flow and THEIR schedule.  Dress WARMLY and be EXTREMELY PATIENT!!!! They will search you, they will search the buses and you will not be allowed back on the bus until THEY say so.  At that point, a Secret Service agent will escort you to your respective bus, one agent per bus.  You may not get off the bus again without a personal security escort until we arrive at the staging area for the parade, which will flow down a protected route reserved for parade participants only. Note:  The Secret Service will have absolutely no sense of humor today!  YES SIR, YES MAAM is about it for comments.  NO MATTER WHAT!  Some of this will probably NOT make sense to you, but regardless see above. ONE designated bus driver is allowed per bus, who must stay with the bus, along with his/her new best friend, the Secret Service agent, for the entire day.
